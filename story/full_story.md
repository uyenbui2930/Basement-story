This is a story about love: beautiful, pure, and unconditional but also messy, selfish and destructive

Once upon a time, there was a pair of father and son, who loved each other very much. The boy is sickly and frail with heart disease, and the father is a scientist who is trying his best to get a cure for him.

The world is not kind to the boy, an outbreak happens worldwide, and an unknown and deadly virus infects people with parasites, turning them into grotesque monsters, slowly losing their sense of self.

In the chaotic world, the father can't find a suitable transplant for his son, whose heart is failing him. However, he has obtained a valuable specimen, a living parasite. After several test trials on animals, he concludes that the parasite can repair the injuries or defections in the host body.

For the first time in forever, the father has regained a spark of hope, he can save his son with this parasite. He knows that the side effects can be deadly, and what he is doing is against his ethics but he can’t just sit by and do nothing.

Don’t use the parasite

Iwafune’s hands are shaking, his mind is a turmoil of love, fear, and dread. Nagare is getting weaker as time goes by, and the world outside is in chaos. If he doesn't make a decision now, it will be too late.

However, he thinks about the fate of the lab animal, who temporarily gets healed but eventually transforms into something monstrous. He doesn't want that one of his worst enemies, let alone his beloved son.

Nagare looks up at him with a weak smile, his small hand clutching his, even on his deathbed, the boy still wants to comfort him.

“I’m sorry, Nagare, I can’t do this.” Tears rolled down Iwafune’s face, into Nagare’s hands. At that moment, he laments God, but most of all, himself, for not being strong enough to make the difficult choice. 

“It’s ok, I know you’ve always tried your best, Iwa-san…” Nagare’s condition is getting worse, his breath is foggy against the breathing mask.

“I love you, Nagare,” Iwafune bites his lips, forcing a smile through the tears.
“I love you too, Father,” Nagare’s weak voice murmurs one last time before his life starts to fade away. 

The flatline on the machine and the beeping of the equipment are so loud in the empty, sterile hospital room, like the emptiness inside his heart right now. 

He pulled out the revolver from his holster, aiming at his temple, his other hand still clutching Nagare’s, “I will see you soon,” a loud bang is heard in the room.

As his body collapses on the bed, the door is busted open, and tons of tentacle monsters rush in, but it no longer matters, as he sees the light at the end of the tunnel, where Nagare is waiting for him, the eternal peace. 

Use the parasite 

There has been a rumor about the infected number rising, the city doesn't know how long it can hold its barricade until these monsters take over.

The hospital is no longer safe, Iwafune packs his stuff and carries Nagare to his hideout, a basement underneath a small apartment, hidden away from the world.

Iwafune gently lays Nagare down on the operation table and hooks up the equipment, the boy's chest rises and falls, seemingly struggling with even breathing.

He holds the container that holds the parasite in, and the grotesque, translucent creature stares back at him. The echo of its pulse is like a mocking of life but also offers hope, a light at the end of the tunnel.

He clutches the cross on his neck, maybe God hasn't abandoned them, and this creature is His way of letting him save Nagare. With that thought in mind, Iwafune starts to do the unthinkable, that goes against his morals but not his love.

Before the anesthesia kicks in, Nagare looks up at him, and asks in a weak voice, muffled by the breathing mask, “Am I going to die, Iwa-san?” 

Iwafune holds the boy's hand and caresses it, his voice gentle like a soothing palm, “No, you will live, I will make sure of it, I found a suitable donor for you,” the lie comes out of his mouth easily, smooth and sweet like honey. 

As the anesthesia takes effect and Nagare's eyelid closes, Iwafune begins the operation, his heart is trembling but his hands are firm. The operation knife smoothly opens the skin and reveals Nagare's heart, on the verge of giving in. 

He then opens the parasite vial, grabs it out with a forceps, and puts it into the open heart. The parasite immediately clutches into the heart, its tendrils wrapping around, fixing the defects. Iwafune is speechless, he is unsure if he is watching God's wonder or the Devil's catastrophe. 

The numbers on the cardiogram are getting better as minutes pass, Nagare condition is stabilized now. Iwafune hesitated as he started to sew the cut, watching the parasite completely integrate inside the heart, sealing their fates inside the abyss of uncertainty.

Maybe he knows exactly what is going on, but desperately clinging to a small chance that things might be different. Iwafune shakily took off his surgery gown and washed his hands, his muscles felt like jelly, only now that he could let himself be weak and succumb to his fears.

He grabs a cold beer can from the fridge and sits down on the chair next to the operation table. The cold liquid soothed the dryness in his throat, but couldn't wash away the weight of his guilt. But looking at Nagare's steady breathing, a faint smile dawns on his face, he touches the boy's hand, and whispers, “Welcome back, Nagare,”

Iwafune doesn't know how much time has passed until he finds himself dozing off, drifting in between dream and reality. He heard voices, roars, and whispers, sometimes a mixture of them.

“Iwa-san…” Iwafune feels a chill running down his spine and jolts awake at the voice, turns his head to the operation table. The air in the room feels cold, like the dread in his heart. But it quickly dissipated, replaced by a high-pitched and innocent voice of his beloved Nagare, his blue eyes blinking at Iwafune while tilting his head. “Iwa-san, are you ok?”

The moment Iwafune hears Nagare's voice, all the suspicion in him vanishes, replaced by relief. He stumbles to stand up and hugs Nagare tightly, not wanting to let the boy slip away between his fingers again. “Thank God you are back, Nagare,” he said as tears streamed down his face, wetting his and Nagare's cheeks. 

Iwafune then pulls out from the hug to cup Nagare's face between his hands, still in disbelief at this miracle. The boy smiles faintly at him, his face rosy with color, and his blue eyes now glint vitality compared to the sickly look before. There's a faint green glow in his left eye but Iwafune brushes it off as a small side effect. 

Chapter 1
Nagare seems pretty healthy for someone who just recovered from a major surgery, the boy is beaming with energy, asking Iwafune if he could walk around. The older man frowns, saying that it is too risky at the moment, making the boy pout but he listens anyway. Iwafune carefully checks the boy's vitals, and all the numbers end up surprisingly well, too well to be natural, like the sharp gaze he can feel from Nagare, too sharp for his liking. 

“Nagare, you have to be honest with me, are you feeling ok right now, any pain, ache, or discomfort?” Iwafune puts away his stethoscope, his face a mixture of relief and worry.

Nagare shook his head, happy, and confidently said, “Nope, I feel great, Iwa-san, probably the greatest I have felt all my life.”

This time, it is Iwafune who feels an aching pain in his heart, it is just a simple statement from the boy, but this freedom was deprived of him due to the unfairness of fate. Maybe, the parasite was a gift from God after all, a chance for Nagare to have a normal life and a chance for Iwafune to redeem himself, to save at least someone in this decaying world. 

Nagare goes through a speedy recovery, and Iwafune makes sure to monitor him at all times, switching between the attentive doctor and doting father persona as he sees fit. For him, medical procedure isn't enough, Iwafune would lay down on the same bed as Nagare and listen to the boy's heartbeat as if to directly confirm that his precious son is still here with him. 

They form their sanctuary, blocking all that noise from the outside world, and Iwafune is contended with this life, but he knows that sooner or later Nagare will be curious and ask him about the outside world. 

“Iwa-san, I’m bored. Can I watch some cartoons on TV?” Nagare pleads with him with the big puppy eyes that he knows Iwafune can’t resist.

“Sure, but just a few episodes, ok, you are still recovering.” Iwafune smiles and turns back to the kitchen space to heat some canned food for them.

The muffled cartoon noises ringing in the background as Iwafune stares at the boiling soup on the stove, his mind seems to swirl together with the liquid in the soup. ‘What now?’ a voice whispered inside his head, ‘even when you can save him, you can't stay down here forever and the outside world is no longer a safe place either’

A loud beeping noise from the smoke detector snaps Iwafune out of his trance, he frantically turns off the stove and fans off the smoke. Then he quickly dumps the soup contents into separate bowls. 

“Sorry, Nagare, it takes too long but let's eat now,” he carries the slightly burned soups to the room. But instead of loud and cheerful cartoon noise from the TV, what he heard is news, about the inflected taking over the city. And as he glances over to the bed, Nagare is staring at the screen with intense focus. 

Iwafune quickly put the bowls down, grabbed the remote, and turned off the TV. An uncomfortable silence filled the room, seconds felt like an eternity, until Nagare's soft voice broke, “Am I one of them, Iwa-san?” The boy's voice was neutral like he was just stating a fact, not asking a question.

“No, what are you talking about, Nagare? You are normal, you are not like them, not at all,” Iwafune frantically grabs Nagare's shoulder, his first instinct is to lie despite feeling guilty over it. 

“Do you still love me even when I turn like them?” Nagare's voice is small, a crack of vulnerability showing, in contrast with earlier neutrality. Iwafune can see the flicker of green in the boy's left eye but the pleading look on his face tugs on the older man's heartstrings.

“Of course, I would still love you no matter what you become, Nagare. But I promise you, I will try my best to make sure you won't turn like that,” Iwafune pulls Nagare into a warm embrace, relishing in the boy's body heat and the steady beating of his heart.

As days pass, Iwafune can no longer tell Nagare to stay put, the boy is now a bundle of energy, clinging to his father in every move, curiously exploring every corner of the basement. Iwafune just knows how to sigh and smile as it is such a good leap from the sickly, bedridden kid he once knew. 

One time, Iwafune had his pen rolled underneath the cabinet, which made me struggle for a while to get it out. When Nagare sees that, he offers to help his father, “let me do it, Iwa-san,” the boy says as he moves the entire cabinet away with his bare hand, which even a grown adult man like Iwafune can't.

Iwafune's mouth gapes in astonishment and fear, as it confirms the change in Nagare that Iwafune desperately ignored purposely. But how can he address it when Nagare looks back at him with a proud expression, like he managed to help his father in some way?

Iwafune forces an awkward smile and pats Nagare's head, “Thank you, Nagare,” but his demeanor does not get past Nagare's sharp look, the boy tilts his head, his habit when he is confused, “Did I do something wrong, Iwa-san?”

Iwafune immediately feels guilty and grabs Nagare's shoulder, trying to reassure the boy, “No, Nagare, you didn't do anything wrong.” He hesitates before continuing, “It is just… this amount of strength is not normal,” 

Nagare tilts his head again as if to digest Iwafune's statement, then he said, “But why does it matter, Iwa-san, if it makes life easier for us,” the boy answers in a matter-of-fact tone like such change to him is not such a big deal. 

The answer makes Iwafune heartache, torn between wanting to explain everything to Nagare but also not wanting to crush his childhood innocence, “It might not be a big deal now, but what if you are hurting, what if it will cause you pain in the future… I can't bear seeing you get hurt, Nagare,” he answers sincerely, his hand caressing the boy's cheek.

Nagare big blue eyes blink, seeing the love and concern in Iwafune's gesture, his small hand then placed on top of Iwafune hand, as if to reassure the older man, “I am fine, Iwa-san, I guarantee, I feel my best right now, and I want us to take advantage of this time together.” As Nagare lets go, he leans over and kisses Iwafune on the cheek, more affectionately than usual, “I love you, father,” he said with a small smile. 

Chapter 2
From that day on, it is as if there is a shift in their relationship, Nagare becomes even clingier and affectionate than usual. So Iwafune can only use his alone time at night, when Nagare is sleeping, to search through the news for the outside world situation. 

He sighs as he realizes their supplies in the basement are running low and sooner or later they have to go to the surface, either to gather supplies or to move to the new place. And in that dark of night, there are times Iwafune wonders if he is being watched, but as he turns around, there's nothing there except Nagare's peaceful sleeping form and the darkness of the room. He brushes it off as stress but the uneasy feeling keeps intensifying day by day. 

“Can I borrow your laptop, Iwa-san?” Nagare asks one day, after finishing his cartoon on the TV. 
“What are you gonna use that for?” Iwafune raised his eyebrows skeptically. 
“Just searching for more cartoons on the internet, Iwa-san, there's not a lot on TV,” Nagare explains, with a small smile and puppy eyes that are Iwafune's weak spot, but there's something sharper about them that Iwafune can't explain. 
“Fine, but not too long, I have to use that too,” Iwafune sighs as he closes his news tabs, and hands over the laptop to Nagare, who accepts it with a happy smile. 

Nagare lays down on the bed, the laptop rests on the pillows, and cheerful cartoon noise is in the background. Iwafune is watching him from the couch, sipping coffee, however, the uneasy feelings from the nights and earlier cannot be washed away.

Iwafune wakes up to Nagare nudging him in the stomach, for some reason, he has dozed off on the couch, which is unusual considering it is still morning. 
“Iwa-san, wake up,” Nagare then sits on his lap, his small hands wrapping around Iwafune's neck as if to stir the older man out of his sleepy state.

Iwafune's head is pounding, his mind groggy and his vision foggy, but even then, he can still see the flicker of green, now shining more prominently on Nagare's left eye. 
“Play with me, Iwa-san,” Nagare pouts, or attempts to pout, as he can still see the small glint of a smile in the corner of the kid's mouth. His small hands played with Iwafune's face, exploring his facial features both with childlike innocence and deliberate touch. “You get lots of stubble now, you need to shave soon, Iwa-san,” Nagare rubs both his hands against the stubble and for some reason, Iwafune feels small, like a prey being played with by the predator. 

Iwafune tries to speak, but his voice is stuck in his throat like there's sand trapping inside, paralyzing him like a prisoner of his own body. Nagare now rests his head on Iwafune's neck, his breath hot against it, sending a shiver down his spine, “Iwa-san is mine, so you have to take better care of yourself, so you can take care of me,” as Nagare finishes his sentence, he bites down on Iwafune neck, not too painful but enough force to leave a mark, and if Iwafune could speak right now, he would yelp, scream or scold Nagare, but none of it slip his mind at the moment. 

Iwafune jolts awake again, cold sweats running down his back and forehead, looking around, Nagare is not on top of him but sleeping soundly in the bed, the laptop still blasting cheerful cartoon noise in the background. Was it a nightmare? Iwafune checks the clock, it is only an hour since then. Was he really in such a deep sleep in the morning? Iwafune then unconsciously touches his neck, shiver runs down his spine as he finds a trace of a bitemark, faint but there.

Despite his panic and worries, Iwafune still gently wakes Nagare up, the boy blinks and rubs his eyes, looking so adorable and innocent compared to the twisted image in the dream, well, Iwafune will give Nagare the benefit of the doubt before confronting him.

“Nagare, please be honest with me, did you do this to me?” Iwafune goes straight to the point, tilting his neck to show Nagare the bite mark.

Nagare just blinked at the mark, then shook his head, “Nope, I didn't do it, I was sleeping the whole time,” then his small hand reached out to touch the mark, “Does it hurt, Iwa-san,” 

Iwafune swats Nagare's hands away, his tone harsher than expected, “I did not raise a liar, Nagare, if it's not you, then is someone in here? Just admit it for god sake,” he gritted his teeth, grabbing the boy's hand with force.

When Iwafune snapped out of his trance of anger, he was immediately filled with regret and shame as he saw Nagare's tear-stained face and his small frame whimpering in pain, “it hurt, Iwa-san,” Iwafune muttered apologizing as he released the hand. 

After that incident, their relationship felt strained, Nagare no longer happily clings to him, and Iwafune, due to guilt, avoids touching the boy. As they quietly eat the soups in their respective bowls, Iwafune wonders if he qualifies to be a father if this whole thing is a mistake. The soup suddenly felt hard to swallow, and he was ashamed of himself for that kind of thought. 

“Are you going to return me, Iwa-san?” Nagare stops eating, his voice quiet but the words ring loudly in Iwafune's ears.

“No, of course not, Nagare, I love you and you know that,” Iwafune corrects him, the pause in between is longer than he would like, “I'm just tired…and I was not myself…at that time…” 

Sometimes, Iwafune looks at himself in the mirror and thinks, did he bite more than he can chew? Like making an impulsive decision to adopt a kid when he can barely take care of himself? Those thoughts make him ashamed of himself but they keep coming back, like water flowing through an open dam. 

Nagare was a difficult kid, and it is not just because of his heart condition, he had been returning to the orphanage several times, due to unknown reasons. But it all made sense, it was said that the boy was a sole survivor of a catastrophic event that wiped out the whole city, it is normal to have some screw loose in the head. And Iwafune, being the bleeding heart he is, brings the kid home without a second thought. 

Maybe they see the loneliness in each other, and by clinging to the other, they think they will fill the void within. Iwafune thinks to himself as the ‘paralysis session’ returns, blurring between dream and reality, but this time, he can talk freely.

“What do you want to do with me, Nagare, or whatever that is taking over his body?” Iwafune asks, his tone calmer and more casual than he would like to. 

“Negative, I am Nagare, Iwa-san, always has been, and for your information, I just want to spend time with you. Isn't it normal for a son to want to bond with his father?” Nagare climbs on top of Iwafune's body, now lying helplessly on the bed. The boy's smile is innocent but the glint in his green left eye said otherwise. 

Iwafune can't respond, his mouth opens and closes but nothing comes out, Nagare words make sense, during the time they lived together before the outbreak, did Iwafune know Nagare? If so, whether the boy is under the parasite's influence or not makes no difference to him.

“You want to save someone, to find a purpose in your meaningless life, Iwa-san,” Nagare hand gently caressed his cheek, “and I happen to be there, a helpless child that needs to be saved, so in a way, it works out for both of us,” 

“But don't worry Iwa-san, I will make sure you never feel meaningless again,” Nagare leans down and kisses him, unexpected but not unwelcoming. The warmth of the kiss is in contrast to the coldness of something that enters Iwafune's body, into his nerves, right to his brain, taking control of his life like Nagare is right now. Is he getting infected, controlled into Nagare's, or the parasite pawn, why does he feel relieved right now, like all the tension and despair has been sucking off his body. 

Chapter 3
Iwafune wakes up feeling renovated or lobotomized, or something in between. Instead of dreading the emptiness inside, he embraces it, whatever Nagare does to him does not get rid of his despair, just makes it more bearable. Speaking of the culprit, Nagare curls up peacefully beside him, cuddling around his arm like the events last night never happened. 

If Iwafune was attached to Nagare before, he is addicted to him now. Nagare is a better drug than alcohol and cigarettes, bringing him a soothing comfort while exposing him to the abyss of his heart. Gently shaking Nagare awake, he is both dreadful and excited about what his salvation might bring to the table today.

Iwafune should be ashamed of this role reversal, he is the father, and he should be the one taking care of his son. But now, he pathetically clings to Nagare for comfort, guidance, and reassurance, like what the boy promised him in that ‘dream verse’. Nagare stirs awake, his blue eyes blinking in the sunlight, the green glint has disappeared for now. Iwafune realized right away, that this is not ‘that’ Nagare, and felt a pang of disappointment in his chest. 

 But even this Nagare is sharp, as the kid clings to his sleeve and tugs, “Are you still mad at me, Iwa-san?” The blue eyes stare at him sincerely, he must be referring to the bite mark incident that left them strained last time, not knowing that they are already made up in the ‘dream world’.

Iwafune ruffles the boy's hair, but the action and the word that followed seem forced and hollowed, “No, I am not mad, Nagare, and I'm sorry too for acting out and hurting you,”
As he looks at Nagare's innocent face, he can't help but think back about the kiss and the blissful activity they did last night, guilt and shame resurface.

“I'm sorry too, Iwa-san,” Nagare looks up at Iwafune, his voice sincere and steady, “unknowingly or not, I think I hurt you more than I realized,” 

Iwafune's heart is pounding inside his chest, he half wants to ask Nagare to confirm but also wants to keep things the same way now. So he acts without thinking, as to him it is the only thing that can confirm his theory, Iwafune tilts Nagare's chin up and admires the deep blue ocean of his eyes before leaning in and kissing him. 

Unlike the ‘dream’, Iwafune is the one in control, while Nagare softly yelps in surprise but submits to it anyway. It is too late to turn back now as they both cross the boundaries, in both worlds. 

What does Iwafune expect out of this kiss, to ‘trigger’ the memory in the ‘dream’ world, to bring the ‘dark’ Nagare, but he does not expect the reaction in front of him? Nagare's eyes threaten to spill with tears, his lips are glossy from the kiss, his cheeks rosy, and the boy's small finger touches his lips as if to get to terms with the situation. 

Guilt pours down on Iwafune like a bucket of ice water, he feels like a real monster in this room, selfish and cowardly, and now he has hurt the most precious to him, the one he tried his best to save. 

Iwafune tries to reach out to comfort Nagare, but does he have the right to do that since he was the one who caused the pain in the first place? “I'm sorry, Nagare…” his voice is barely a whisper. But no matter how many empty words he spits out, the damage is already done, and their relationship will never be the same again.

“I don't hate it…” Nagare finally speaks after what feels like an eternity, his small hands fiddling awkwardly with the hem of his shirt, making it not clear if he is saying the truth or just saying it to please Iwafune. 

What Nagare just said opens a can of worms, complicating their already messy relationship, “what do you mean by that, Nagare?” There are a million questions Iwafune wants to ask, but he wants to gauge the situation first by letting Nagare have a first say.

“It means I don't mind doing it again with Iwa-san,” Iwafune never expected Nagare's straightforward nature would hit him right in the chest like a sledgehammer, breaking down any self-preservation he had left. 

“You don't know what you just said, Nagare,” Iwafune covers his face with his palm, then hits his forehead in confusion and frustration, mostly at himself. 

“Oh, Iwa-san, I know exactly what I want,” Nagare said, his voice absolutely unlike the fragile facade earlier, it made Iwafune wonder what is an act and what is real. He looks into the boy's eyes, there is no trace of green, not yet, which for some reason, scared him even more.

As if sensing Iwafune's discomfort, Nagare continues his monologue, “Unlike adults, kids like me are more open and honest to their feelings,” Nagare gets closer, his innocent face contrasting with his wisdom, “It's ok to let go, Iwa-san, it is not a shame to admit what you like,” 

“This is wrong, this is so wrong, Nagare,” Iwafune slowly paced away from the boy, until he reached the wall, trapped between it and Nagare. “It was a mistake, ok, and I would be a big fool if I dared to repeat it,” Iwafune clutches his head as if that could block out the intensity of Nagare's gaze.

“You could be a fool, but at least you can live true to yourself, Iwa-san,” Nagare words are still strangely mature but now carry a more sincere tone, “the sooner you let go, the easier you can truly live,” the boy reaches over, hugging Iwafune, his short frame can only reach up to his waist.

“Who are you, what are you doing to my son? bring him back, bring Nagare back…” Iwafune collapses, crouching down on the floor, clutching his head in frustration, this is too much, this whole thing was a mistake. He knew it, he should not defy nature in the first place.

“Iwa-san, calm down,” it is just a simple word but its commanding tone snaps Iwafune out of his trance, and looks up at Nagare, who looks down at him with a gaze mixed with pity, and sadness. The boy then cups Iwafune's cheeks between his hands, gently like a precious thing, “Please let me take care of you, you have done enough,” 

Nagare's thumbs gently wiped out the tears that threatened to spill on Iwafune's face, “I am always myself, Iwa-san, as I know myself better than anyone,” he rested his forehead against Iwafune, “was my old self an act? Not really, because I truly feel safe with you, so I can be a child around you. But this persona, it is also me, Iwa-san, messy and ugly, just like yours…” Nagare confesses, like a sinner to the priest. 

Iwafune is too numb to reply, he is now like a deer in the headlights, like a fawn trapped in the grip of a lion, instinct tells him that he should fight back, but the bleakness of reality tells him not to. Deep inside, he wants to believe Nagare, but if the boy already deceived him once, what to prove that this is not another act?
“Messy and ugly,” Nagare repeated, his voice soft but unyielding. “The part of me that wants too much, that takes and takes until there’s nothing left. That’s me too, Iwa-san.” Their face still pressed close to each other, Nagare's hands effectively trap Iwafune in place, “if you give me your everything, I will give my all to you as well,” he smiles as he leans in close, too close for Iwafune comfort, his blue eyes stare at Iwafune's brown ones as if to hypnotize them. Then, as a final act before the curtain call, is their third kiss. 
Iwafune is left paralyzed on the spot, not by any external force, but by his fear, a kiss is not simply a kiss, but a promise, a claim, and a curse that Nagare put on him. Seeing that Iwafune is stiff on the spot, Nagare plays with the older man's face, tilts his head innocently, and sing-song in his childish voice, “Come on, Iwa-san, don't be so down, we got lots of things to do,” the boy grabs Iwafune hand and pull him up. 

Chapter 4
Nagare does most of the personal hygiene for him, as Iwafune still can't break out of the shell shock earlier, which the boy doesn't seem to mind, as if eerily resembling when Iwafune took care of a sick Nagare. As Nagare sits him down on the kitchen table, he pats Iwafune on the head before running to heat some food on the stove, standing on a stool, while singing a cartoon song. “We are almost out of food, let's go shopping soon, Iwa-san,” Nagare reminds him but all Iwafune can do now is stare blankly at the boy back.

Nagare sets the 2 plates down, but Iwafune doesn't even move to take a spoon, the boy sighs and moves his chair next to him, attempting to feed him, “say aaaa Iwa-san,” Nagare said sweetly as he blows on the food and pushes a spoonful to Iwafune mouth, some of the food spilled and drop-down Iwafune face, to which Nagare chuckles and wipes it with a napkin, “Look at you, so messy,” The words trigger distant memories in Iwafune when he just adopted Nagare and had a hard time feeding him. Nagare's behavior right now just mimics everything he did to the boy before. It is sweet in a way as it is twisted. 

“I have always remembered, Iwa-san, you were the only one who was patient with me, who loved me with all your heart…” Nagare stops to put the bowl down, his tone sincere like a confession, “You didn't give up on me, even when you should, and I am grateful for that,” he grabs Iwafune's hand and gently squeezes it, “so even when it is hard to keep living now, please live for me, I will repay for all you did to me, Iwa-san,” 

The words from Nagare sound like both a command and a plea and Iwafune could sense a crack in the boy's facade, where his small, vulnerable son resides, how can Iwafune ever say no to him? Iwafune blinks, clenches, and unclenches his palms, fractions of control have returned to his body. “Nagare, you don't have to pretend, not with me, please tell me everything, have I ever denied you anything?” His first words struggle to come out after a long period of not talking but it is like a relief to him. 
“You’ve never denied me anything, Iwa-san,” Nagare said, his voice soft, almost wistful. He leaned closer, resting his forehead against Iwafune’s shoulder. “But maybe that’s the problem.”
“Why is that a problem?” Iwafune unconsciously pats Nagare's head, their touches so casual now, in contrast with the tense atmosphere just not long ago.

“I can never grow up like that, Iwa-san,” Nagare's face is hidden from view but Iwafune knows it is the words that are spoken from the heart that make his own heart clench in realization. 

“So what should I do now, Nagare?” Iwafune never thought they would have a heart-to-heart after such a messed-up confrontation.

“Just be true to yourself, Iwa-san, and I want you to walk along with me, not behind me, I want to grow together with you,” Nagare responds, his arms wrap around Iwafune's neck, the two form an awkward, rigid kind of embrace but soon melt into a more relaxed and natural one. 

After the two break away from the embrace, they go back to their food, the silence in the room is not as suffocating as earlier. Then they do the dishes together, something that Iwafune always volunteers to do, and brush Nagare off whenever the boy asks to help before. They have partially opened their hearts to each other but neither has addressed the elephant in the room, the kisses, and the shifting nature of their relationship.

“Iwa-san, you have to stop doing everything on your own, you can depend on me too,” Nagare said as he dried off the dishes, his words a continuation of what they just discussed. 

Iwafune blinks then pauses in pleasant surprise, he smiles at Nagare and ruffles his hair, “Understood, you are still a good kid after all, Nagare,”

“I'm not a child, Iwa-san,” Nagare retorts, but his adorable pout and his childish voice make the statement not very convincing.

“Sure, sure, you are not a child, Nagare, as no child would make a move like you did,” Iwafune said in a mocking tone that he did not mean to, and immediately regretted it, as he saw Nagare freeze at the statement.

“Sorry, I don't mean it like that, but I guess it is better to move forward knowing what your true feelings are for me, right, Nagare?” Iwafune feels terrible inside, playing a bad guy right now, but it is what is needed to nudge Nagare's answer out. 

“My true feelings…” Nagare murmurs, mostly to himself, “I have not confessed yet huh?” he tilts his head, then jumps down from the stool. He is always so composed and confident but at this moment, Iwafune can catch a sign of nervousness.

“Well, if I have to say, I have been in love with you for a long time, Iwa-san” Nagare's voice was sincere and Iwafune could catch a glimpse of the boy he raised, “From the day you took me in, you never pressure me to conform, I love the way you care, love how attentive you are, even when I am a lost cause, you never give up on me. That is when I fell in love, I found someone who loves me, unconditionally and wholeheartedly, and I want to love you the same way, Iwa-san,”

Iwafune blinks in surprise, he didn't know that his love would also shape Nagare's love for him, what seems like common sense would not be so easy to understand for broken people like them. He isn't sure what shape of love they shared, is that more than one shade, mixed up and messy, unlike the purity they used to believe in. Regardless, Iwafune knows one thing for sure, he loves Nagare, and nothing in this world can change that. 

A small smile dawns on Iwafune's face, he looks at Nagare as something precious that only he can love and protect, no matter what he becomes. “Come here, Nagare,” Iwafune opens his arm for a hug, then soon after, Nagare runs into that for an embrace, his small frame wrapped between Iwafune arms. “I love you too, Nagare,” So far, it is a mutual confession and Iwafune is happy with that, no matter the outcome. 


Chapter 5
There is not only one, but multiple elephants in the room that Iwafune needs to address if he can even pry any answer out of Nagare, but the most pressing one, the parasite, he has to know if the boy is aware of it, he might lie as always but it is better than them playing games and going nowhere. 

But when it comes to the actual confrontation, Iwafune hesitates, plagued by guilt and self-doubt, as he was the one to use the parasite on Nagare in the first place, so he has no room to complain. 

Nagare, being sharp as ever, can sense Iwafune unease miles away, but he doesn't judge, and just calmly says, “You look like you have a lot on your mind, Iwa-san, is this about me,” his small hand reaches out to cup Iwafune cheek, the gesture calming and comforting.

“Yes, it is about you, about us,” Iwafune in turn put his hand on top of Nagare's chest, feeling the steady heartbeat, like the constant reminder of his sins. “Are you aware of the change in your body, Nagare?” his throat feels like it is filled with sand, and the words come out with difficulty.

Nagare's hand moves to place on top of Iwafune, his look knowing and understanding, “I know, Iwa-san, you have saved me, with this power,” he answers with confidence.

“But, I did something horrible to you, because of my selfishness…” Iwafune cries out, but Nagare gently shushes him, and says, “No, you are wrong, Iwa-san, you gave me a gift of life, a strength to keep on living,” he continues with a smile, a sincere, childlike one, “…with you,” 

And for the first time in forever, Iwafune manages to see the parasite in action, not in paralysis but in a sane and awake condition, the almost translucent tentacles spread out from Nagare's back, wriggling around in eeriness and strangely elegant movements.

One of the tendrils reaches out and touches Iwafune's cheek, it touches cold and slimy, sending goosebumps down Iwafune's spine, he still remembers this sensation in that paralysis session. “I'm sorry I used it on you before, you were sad, so…” Nagare looks down, as he confesses his wrongdoing like a child admits to doing bad things behind the parent's back.

“What do you mean, Nagare?”, with a trembling hand, Iwafune touches the tendril, real and filled with life, and it is not a dream he just can wake up from.

“I tempered a bit with your brain, to make you less sad…” Nagare's voice is quiet and a bit guilty, he flinches as Iwafune touches his tentacle.

Iwafune should be mad, and should yell at Nagare for violating his mind without permission but didn't he do the same thing to the boy before, he doesn't have the right to complain. So he sighs with acceptance and gestures to Nagare to come closer, “Do you hate me being sad, Nagare?” he asks, hand patting the back of Nagare's head. 

“I don't hate you being sad, Iwa-san, I hate that I couldn't do anything for you back then, always so helpless as you did everything for me,” Nagare's big blue eyes stared at him, the deep ocean iris-like a gateway to the boy soul, sincere and earnest, “so I want to use this power to help you, even when it might not be a right choice?” Nagare seems confused and conflicted, which is rare to the confident facade he built, it reminds Iwafune that the vulnerable young boy is still there.

“I'm not mad at you, Nagare,” Iwafune lifts the boy's chin to look directly at him, “I know you have good intentions, but communicate with me next time, ok,” maybe, deep down, Nagare is still the same child, now equipped with wiseness and power but with the same moral naivety of a child, who wants to make his father happy. 
Iwafune’s thumb brushed against Nagare’s cheek, wiping away a stray tear Nagare hadn’t realized had fallen. “You’ve always been a good kid, Nagare. Don’t ever think otherwise.” Hearing that, Nagare quietly nods and leans more into Iwafune's touch, seemingly happy at the reassurance, his tentacles wiggling around, touching Iwafune back in the form of an awkward hug.
“Iwa-san, can we kiss?” Nagare's voice is small and shy, in contrast with his bravado in the dream verse. Iwafune hesitates at first but then gives in as to how can he say no to Nagare, after the boy cries like that, he blames his weak spot for him.
 He sighs, “Fine, we can kiss, but not after you tell me where you learned this from,” it's ironic to get into ‘dad mode’ before he starts doing such not-so-dad things to Nagare, as it has been bugging him for a while. 
Nagare’s fingers tightened slightly on Iwafune’s shirt, as if afraid he might pull away. Iwafune’s thumb traced gentle circles on Nagare’s cheek, grounding them both in the moment. After a brief silence, the boy finally answered, “From the movies on your laptop, Iwa-san, I saw them after watching cartoons, they have lots of kissing and…”, Iwafune covered the boy's mouth as his cheeks flushed red, so it was his fault after all, he wants to punch himself for ruining Nagare's innocence. 
Nagare murmurs something unheard due to his hand, when he pulls away, the boy smiles and says, “But it is normal right, those stuff I saw in the movies, isn't that the thing that people who love each other do?” Nagare tilts his head, the gesture innocent enough but those words, they are not. 
“Well,” Iwafune sighs and scratches his head, “yes, people do those things when they are in love, but it isn't something a kid like you should learn from,” Iwafune tries to remain stern but Nagare's confused look makes it hard to stay so. 
“Iwa-san,” Nagare said softly, his voice steady despite the uncertainty in his eyes, “if it’s something people do when they love each other, then… shouldn’t it be okay for us too?” His big blue eyes stare at Iwafune, eyes who know what they are doing.
Iwafune covers his face with his palm and sighs loudly, he has been trying to stall for time, but this discussion would come to nowhere unless he gives Nagare what the boy wants, so he cups Nagare's cheeks between his hands, tilts it up and gives him the promised kiss.
It's their fourth one, this time, there's no manipulation, no high emotion, just a slow tango of emotions. The kiss is slow and gentle, but it is no chaste kiss, as their tongues dance and entangle in each other, more used to it than they admitted to. He deepens the kiss as his hand covers Nagare's head protectively.
As their lips parted, Iwafune rested his forehead against Nagare’s, his breath uneven. “You don’t understand what you’re asking for, Nagare,” he murmured, his voice heavy with regret. “And I don’t think I can stop giving it to you.”
Nagare smiles at that statement, his face still flushed from the kiss, seemingly pleased with the outcome, “Isn't that a good thing, Iwa-san? Just let go and follow your heart?” he chuckles, the irony hangs in the air, does Nagare's artificial heart more human than his? 
Iwafune closed his eyes, the weight of Nagare’s words pressing against him like a vice. Follow your heart. The phrase sounded so simple, so easy, yet it carried an unbearable weight. His heart wasn’t something he could trust—it had already led him to cross lines he never thought he would, all for this boy who seemed to blur every boundary he’d ever known.
“You make it sound like it’s that simple,” Iwafune muttered, his voice low and strained. His hands slid down to Nagare’s shoulders, as if grounding himself. “But hearts don’t always know what’s right, Nagare. Sometimes, they lead you straight to hell.”
Nagare tilted his head, his smile softening, but his eyes held that sharp, knowing glint that always unnerved Iwafune. “Then let’s go to hell together, Iwa-san,” he said with a quiet conviction, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. “If it’s with you, I don’t mind.”
Iwafune’s breath hitched, the boy’s words striking something deep within him. He wanted to protest, to tell Nagare that he didn’t understand what he was saying, but the look in his eyes—earnest, unyielding—stopped him.
“You don’t get it, kid,” Iwafune said after a long pause, his voice hoarse. “You’re too young to be talking like that. Too young to be throwing your life away for someone like me.”
Nagare’s smile widened, but it was tinged with something bittersweet. “Iwa-san, you’re the one who gave me this life. So if I want to spend it with you, isn’t that my choice?”
Iwafune couldn’t find the words to argue. His hands tightened slightly on Nagare’s shoulders, and for a moment, he just stared at the boy—this strange, brilliant, maddening boy who had become the center of his world.
“You’re impossible,” he finally muttered, a faint, rueful smile tugging at his lips.
Nagare chuckled softly, his tentacles curling around Iwafune’s arms in a gesture that felt almost affectionate. “And yet, here we are.”
For a moment, the room was quiet, the weight of their shared understanding settling over them. Iwafune knew there was no going back, no undoing what had already been done. All he could do now was move forward, wherever that path might lead—be it salvation or damnation.
“Fine,” Iwafune said at last, his voice barely above a whisper. “We’ll figure it out. Together.”
Nagare’s smile brightened, and for the first time in what felt like forever, Iwafune felt a flicker of something close to peace. Even if it was fleeting, even if it was fragile, it was enough—for now.
