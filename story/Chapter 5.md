There is not only one, but multiple elephants in the room that Iwafune needs to address if he can even pry any answer out of Nagare, but the most pressing one, the parasite, he has to know if the boy is aware of it, he might lie as always but it is better than them playing games and going nowhere. 

But when it comes to the actual confrontation, Iwafune hesitates, plagued by guilt and self-doubt, as he was the one to use the parasite on Nagare in the first place, so he has no room to complain. 

Nagare, being sharp as ever, can sense Iwafune unease miles away, but he doesn't judge, and just calmly says, “You look like you have a lot on your mind, Iwa-san, is this about me,” his small hand reaches out to cup Iwafune cheek, the gesture calming and comforting.

“Yes, it is about you, about us,” Iwafune in turn put his hand on top of Nagare's chest, feeling the steady heartbeat, like the constant reminder of his sins. “Are you aware of the change in your body, Nagare?” his throat feels like it is filled with sand, and the words come out with difficulty.

Nagare's hand moves to place on top of Iwafune, his look knowing and understanding, “I know, Iwa-san, you have saved me, with this power,” he answers with confidence.

"But, I did something horrible to you, because of my selfishness…" Iwafune cries out, but Nagare gently shushes him, and says, "No, you are wrong, Iwa-san, you gave me a gift of life, a strength to keep on living," he continues with a smile, a sincere, childlike one, "…with you,"

"You've always tried to save me, haven't you, Iwa-san?" Nagare's hand found his. "Even when you thought you couldn't."

Iwafune's breath caught. What did Nagare mean by that? The surgery? The adoption? Or something older—

"I'm glad you did," Nagare continued, his smile soft. "Even if it took you a while."

*Took you a while.* Years. Years between leaving a child in a burning city and finding him again in a cold orphanage. Between failure and attempted redemption.

But Nagare couldn't know that. Could he?

And for the first time in forever, Iwafune manages to see the parasite in action, not in paralysis but in a sane and awake condition, the almost translucent tentacles spread out from Nagare's back, wriggling around in eeriness and strangely elegant movements.

One of the tendrils reaches out and touches Iwafune's cheek, it touches cold and slimy, sending goosebumps down Iwafune's spine, he still remembers this sensation in that paralysis session. “I'm sorry I used it on you before, you were sad, so…” Nagare looks down, as he confesses his wrongdoing like a child admits to doing bad things behind the parent's back.

“What do you mean, Nagare?”, with a trembling hand, Iwafune touches the tendril, real and filled with life, and it is not a dream he just can wake up from.

"I tampered a bit with your brain, to make you less sad…" Nagare's voice is quiet and a bit guilty, he flinches as Iwafune touches his tentacle.

Iwafune should be mad, and should yell at Nagare for violating his mind without permission but didn't he do the same thing to the boy before, he doesn't have the right to complain. So he sighs with acceptance and gestures to Nagare to come closer, “Do you hate me being sad, Nagare?” he asks, hand patting the back of Nagare's head. 

“I don't hate you being sad, Iwa-san, I hate that I couldn't do anything for you back then, always so helpless as you did everything for me,” Nagare's big blue eyes stared at him, the deep ocean iris-like a gateway to the boy soul, sincere and earnest, “so I want to use this power to help you, even when it might not be a right choice?” Nagare seems confused and conflicted, which is rare to the confident facade he built, it reminds Iwafune that the vulnerable young boy is still there.

“I'm not mad at you, Nagare,” Iwafune lifts the boy's chin to look directly at him, “I know you have good intentions, but communicate with me next time, ok,” maybe, deep down, Nagare is still the same child, now equipped with wiseness and power but with the same moral naivety of a child, who wants to make his father happy. 
Iwafune’s thumb brushed against Nagare’s cheek, wiping away a stray tear Nagare hadn’t realized had fallen. “You’ve always been a good kid, Nagare. Don’t ever think otherwise.” Hearing that, Nagare quietly nods and leans more into Iwafune's touch, seemingly happy at the reassurance, his tentacles wiggling around, touching Iwafune back in the form of an awkward hug.
“Iwa-san, can we kiss?” Nagare's voice is small and shy, in contrast with his bravado in the dream verse. Iwafune hesitates at first but then gives in as to how can he say no to Nagare, after the boy cries like that, he blames his weak spot for him.
 He sighs, “Fine, we can kiss, but not after you tell me where you learned this from,” it's ironic to get into ‘dad mode’ before he starts doing such not-so-dad things to Nagare, as it has been bugging him for a while. 
Nagare’s fingers tightened slightly on Iwafune’s shirt, as if afraid he might pull away. Iwafune’s thumb traced gentle circles on Nagare’s cheek, grounding them both in the moment. After a brief silence, the boy finally answered, “From the movies on your laptop, Iwa-san, I saw them after watching cartoons, they have lots of kissing and…”, Iwafune covered the boy's mouth as his cheeks flushed red, so it was his fault after all, he wants to punch himself for ruining Nagare's innocence. 
Nagare murmurs something unheard due to his hand, when he pulls away, the boy smiles and says, “But it is normal right, those stuff I saw in the movies, isn't that the thing that people who love each other do?” Nagare tilts his head, the gesture innocent enough but those words, they are not. 
“Well,” Iwafune sighs and scratches his head, “yes, people do those things when they are in love, but it isn't something a kid like you should learn from,” Iwafune tries to remain stern but Nagare's confused look makes it hard to stay so. 
“Iwa-san,” Nagare said softly, his voice steady despite the uncertainty in his eyes, “if it’s something people do when they love each other, then… shouldn’t it be okay for us too?” His big blue eyes stare at Iwafune, eyes who know what they are doing.
Iwafune covers his face with his palm and sighs loudly, he has been trying to stall for time, but this discussion would come to nowhere unless he gives Nagare what the boy wants, so he cups Nagare's cheeks between his hands, tilts it up and gives him the promised kiss.
It's their fourth one, this time, there's no manipulation, no high emotion, just a slow tango of emotions. The kiss is slow and gentle, but it is no chaste kiss, as their tongues dance and entangle in each other, more used to it than they admitted to. He deepens the kiss as his hand covers Nagare's head protectively.
As their lips parted, Iwafune rested his forehead against Nagare’s, his breath uneven. “You don’t understand what you’re asking for, Nagare,” he murmured, his voice heavy with regret. “And I don’t think I can stop giving it to you.”
Nagare smiles at that statement, his face still flushed from the kiss, seemingly pleased with the outcome, “Isn't that a good thing, Iwa-san? Just let go and follow your heart?” he chuckles, the irony hangs in the air, does Nagare's artificial heart more human than his? 
Iwafune closed his eyes, the weight of Nagare’s words pressing against him like a vice. Follow your heart. The phrase sounded so simple, so easy, yet it carried an unbearable weight. His heart wasn’t something he could trust—it had already led him to cross lines he never thought he would, all for this boy who seemed to blur every boundary he’d ever known.
“You make it sound like it’s that simple,” Iwafune muttered, his voice low and strained. His hands slid down to Nagare’s shoulders, as if grounding himself. “But hearts don’t always know what’s right, Nagare. Sometimes, they lead you straight to hell.”
Nagare tilted his head, his smile softening, but his eyes held that sharp, knowing glint that always unnerved Iwafune. “Then let’s go to hell together, Iwa-san,” he said with a quiet conviction, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. “If it’s with you, I don’t mind.”
Iwafune’s breath hitched, the boy’s words striking something deep within him. He wanted to protest, to tell Nagare that he didn’t understand what he was saying, but the look in his eyes—earnest, unyielding—stopped him.
“You don’t get it, kid,” Iwafune said after a long pause, his voice hoarse. “You’re too young to be talking like that. Too young to be throwing your life away for someone like me.”
Nagare’s smile widened, but it was tinged with something bittersweet. “Iwa-san, you’re the one who gave me this life. So if I want to spend it with you, isn’t that my choice?”
Iwafune couldn’t find the words to argue. His hands tightened slightly on Nagare’s shoulders, and for a moment, he just stared at the boy—this strange, brilliant, maddening boy who had become the center of his world.
“You’re impossible,” he finally muttered, a faint, rueful smile tugging at his lips.
Nagare chuckled softly, his tentacles curling around Iwafune’s arms in a gesture that felt almost affectionate. “And yet, here we are.”
For a moment, the room was quiet, the weight of their shared understanding settling over them. Iwafune knew there was no going back, no undoing what had already been done. All he could do now was move forward, wherever that path might lead—be it salvation or damnation.
“Fine,” Iwafune said at last, his voice barely above a whisper. “We’ll figure it out. Together.”
Nagare’s smile brightened, and for the first time in what felt like forever, Iwafune felt a flicker of something close to peace. Even if it was fleeting, even if it was fragile, it was enough—for now.
