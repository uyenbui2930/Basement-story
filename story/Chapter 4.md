Nagare does most of the personal hygiene for him, as Iwafune still can't break out of the shell shock earlier, which the boy doesn't seem to mind, as if eerily resembling when Iwafune took care of a sick Nagare. As Nagare sits him down on the kitchen table, he pats Iwafune on the head before running to heat some food on the stove, standing on a stool, while singing a cartoon song. "We are almost out of food, let's go shopping soon, Iwa-san," Nagare reminds him but all Iwafune can do now is stare blankly at the boy's back.

Nagare sets the 2 plates down, but Iwafune doesn't even move to take a spoon, the boy sighs and moves his chair next to him, attempting to feed him, “say aaaa Iwa-san,” Nagare said sweetly as he blows on the food and pushes a spoonful to Iwafune mouth, some of the food spilled and drop-down Iwafune face, to which Nagare chuckles and wipes it with a napkin, “Look at you, so messy,” The words trigger distant memories in Iwafune when he just adopted Nagare and had a hard time feeding him. Nagare's behavior right now just mimics everything he did to the boy before. It is sweet in a way as it is twisted. 

“I have always remembered, Iwa-san, you were the only one who was patient with me, who loved me with all your heart…” Nagare stops to put the bowl down, his tone sincere like a confession, “You didn't give up on me, even when you should, and I am grateful for that,” he grabs Iwafune's hand and gently squeezes it, “so even when it is hard to keep living now, please live for me, I will repay for all you did to me, Iwa-san,” 

The words from Nagare sound like both a command and a plea and Iwafune could sense a crack in the boy's facade, where his small, vulnerable son resides, how can Iwafune ever say no to him? Iwafune blinks, clenches, and unclenches his palms, fractions of control have returned to his body. “Nagare, you don't have to pretend, not with me, please tell me everything, have I ever denied you anything?” His first words struggle to come out after a long period of not talking but it is like a relief to him. 
“You’ve never denied me anything, Iwa-san,” Nagare said, his voice soft, almost wistful. He leaned closer, resting his forehead against Iwafune’s shoulder. “But maybe that’s the problem.”
“Why is that a problem?” Iwafune unconsciously pats Nagare's head, their touches so casual now, in contrast with the tense atmosphere just not long ago.

“I can never grow up like that, Iwa-san,” Nagare's face is hidden from view but Iwafune knows it is the words that are spoken from the heart that make his own heart clench in realization. 

“So what should I do now, Nagare?” Iwafune never thought they would have a heart-to-heart after such a messed-up confrontation.

“Just be true to yourself, Iwa-san, and I want you to walk along with me, not behind me, I want to grow together with you,” Nagare responds, his arms wrap around Iwafune's neck, the two form an awkward, rigid kind of embrace but soon melt into a more relaxed and natural one. 

After the two break away from the embrace, they go back to their food, the silence in the room is not as suffocating as earlier. Then they do the dishes together, something that Iwafune always volunteers to do, and brush Nagare off whenever the boy asks to help before. They have partially opened their hearts to each other but neither has addressed the elephant in the room, the kisses, and the shifting nature of their relationship.

“Iwa-san, you have to stop doing everything on your own, you can depend on me too,” Nagare said as he dried off the dishes, his words a continuation of what they just discussed. 

Iwafune blinks then pauses in pleasant surprise, he smiles at Nagare and ruffles his hair, “Understood, you are still a good kid after all, Nagare,”

“I'm not a child, Iwa-san,” Nagare retorts, but his adorable pout and his childish voice make the statement not very convincing.

“Sure, sure, you are not a child, Nagare, as no child would make a move like you did,” Iwafune said in a mocking tone that he did not mean to, and immediately regretted it, as he saw Nagare freeze at the statement.

“Sorry, I don't mean it like that, but I guess it is better to move forward knowing what your true feelings are for me, right, Nagare?” Iwafune feels terrible inside, playing a bad guy right now, but it is what is needed to nudge Nagare's answer out. 

“My true feelings…” Nagare murmurs, mostly to himself, “I have not confessed yet huh?” he tilts his head, then jumps down from the stool. He is always so composed and confident but at this moment, Iwafune can catch a sign of nervousness.

“Well, if I have to say, I have been in love with you for a long time, Iwa-san” Nagare's voice was sincere and Iwafune could catch a glimpse of the boy he raised, “From the day you took me in, you never pressure me to conform, I love the way you care, love how attentive you are, even when I am a lost cause, you never give up on me. That is when I fell in love, I found someone who loves me, unconditionally and wholeheartedly, and I want to love you the same way, Iwa-san,”

Iwafune blinks in surprise, he didn't know that his love would also shape Nagare's love for him, what seems like common sense would not be so easy to understand for broken people like them. He isn't sure what shape of love they shared, is that more than one shade, mixed up and messy, unlike the purity they used to believe in. Regardless, Iwafune knows one thing for sure, he loves Nagare, and nothing in this world can change that. 

A small smile dawns on Iwafune's face, he looks at Nagare as something precious that only he can love and protect, no matter what he becomes. “Come here, Nagare,” Iwafune opens his arm for a hug, then soon after, Nagare runs into that for an embrace, his small frame wrapped between Iwafune arms. “I love you too, Nagare,” So far, it is a mutual confession and Iwafune is happy with that, no matter the outcome.
