This is a story about love: beautiful, pure, and unconditional but also messy, selfish and destructive

Once upon a time, there was a pair of father and son, who loved each other very much. The boy is sickly and frail with heart disease, and the father is a scientist who is trying his best to get a cure for him.

The world is not kind to the boy, an outbreak happens worldwide, and an unknown and deadly virus infects people with parasites, turning them into grotesque monsters, slowly losing their sense of self.

In the chaotic world, the father can't find a suitable transplant for his son, whose heart is failing him. However, he has obtained a valuable specimen, a living parasite. After several test trials on animals, he concludes that the parasite can repair the injuries or defections in the host body.

For the first time in forever, the father has regained a spark of hope, he can save his son with this parasite. He knows that the side effects can be deadly, and what he is doing is against his ethics but he can’t just sit by and do nothing.

Don’t use the parasite

Iwafune’s hands are shaking, his mind is a turmoil of love, fear, and dread. Nagare is getting weaker as time goes by, and the world outside is in chaos. If he doesn't make a decision now, it will be too late.

However, he thinks about the fate of the lab animal, who temporarily gets healed but eventually transforms into something monstrous. He doesn't want that one of his worst enemies, let alone his beloved son.

Nagare looks up at him with a weak smile, his small hand clutching his, even on his deathbed, the boy still wants to comfort him.

“I’m sorry, Nagare, I can’t do this.” Tears rolled down Iwafune’s face, into Nagare’s hands. At that moment, he laments God, but most of all, himself, for not being strong enough to make the difficult choice. 

“It’s ok, I know you’ve always tried your best, Iwa-san…” Nagare’s condition is getting worse, his breath is foggy against the breathing mask.

“I love you, Nagare,” Iwafune bites his lips, forcing a smile through the tears.
“I love you too, Father,” Nagare’s weak voice murmurs one last time before his life starts to fade away. 

The flatline on the machine and the beeping of the equipment are so loud in the empty, sterile hospital room, like the emptiness inside his heart right now. 

He pulled out the revolver from his holster, aiming at his temple, his other hand still clutching Nagare’s, “I will see you soon,” a loud bang is heard in the room.

As his body collapses on the bed, the door is busted open, and tons of tentacle monsters rush in, but it no longer matters, as he sees the light at the end of the tunnel, where Nagare is waiting for him, the eternal peace. 

Use the parasite 

There has been a rumor about the infected number rising, the city doesn't know how long it can hold its barricade until these monsters take over.

The hospital is no longer safe, Iwafune packs his stuff and carries Nagare to his hideout, a basement underneath a small apartment, hidden away from the world.

Iwafune gently lays Nagare down on the operation table and hooks up the equipment, the boy's chest rises and falls, seemingly struggling with even breathing.

He holds the container that holds the parasite in, and the grotesque, translucent creature stares back at him. The echo of its pulse is like a mocking of life but also offers hope, a light at the end of the tunnel.

He clutches the cross on his neck, maybe God hasn't abandoned them, and this creature is His way of letting him save Nagare. With that thought in mind, Iwafune starts to do the unthinkable, that goes against his morals but not his love.

Before the anesthesia kicks in, Nagare looks up at him, and asks in a weak voice, muffled by the breathing mask, “Am I going to die, Iwa-san?” 

Iwafune holds the boy's hand and caresses it, his voice gentle like a soothing palm, “No, you will live, I will make sure of it, I found a suitable donor for you,” the lie comes out of his mouth easily, smooth and sweet like honey. 

As the anesthesia takes effect and Nagare's eyelid closes, Iwafune begins the operation, his heart is trembling but his hands are firm. The operation knife smoothly opens the skin and reveals Nagare's heart, on the verge of giving in. 

He then opens the parasite vial, grabs it out with a forceps, and puts it into the open heart. The parasite immediately clutches into the heart, its tendrils wrapping around, fixing the defects. Iwafune is speechless, he is unsure if he is watching God's wonder or the Devil's catastrophe. 

The numbers on the cardiogram are getting better as minutes pass, Nagare condition is stabilized now. Iwafune hesitated as he started to sew the cut, watching the parasite completely integrate inside the heart, sealing their fates inside the abyss of uncertainty.

Maybe he knows exactly what is going on, but desperately clinging to a small chance that things might be different. Iwafune shakily took off his surgery gown and washed his hands, his muscles felt like jelly, only now that he could let himself be weak and succumb to his fears.

He grabs a cold beer can from the fridge and sits down on the chair next to the operation table. The cold liquid soothed the dryness in his throat, but couldn't wash away the weight of his guilt. But looking at Nagare's steady breathing, a faint smile dawns on his face, he touches the boy's hand, and whispers, “Welcome back, Nagare,”

Iwafune doesn't know how much time has passed until he finds himself dozing off, drifting in between dream and reality. He heard voices, roars, and whispers, sometimes a mixture of them.

“Iwa-san…” Iwafune feels a chill running down his spine and jolts awake at the voice, turns his head to the operation table. The air in the room feels cold, like the dread in his heart. But it quickly dissipated, replaced by a high-pitched and innocent voice of his beloved Nagare, his blue eyes blinking at Iwafune while tilting his head. “Iwa-san, are you ok?”

The moment Iwafune hears Nagare's voice, all the suspicion in him vanishes, replaced by relief. He stumbles to stand up and hugs Nagare tightly, not wanting to let the boy slip away between his fingers again. “Thank God you are back, Nagare,” he said as tears streamed down his face, wetting his and Nagare's cheeks. 

Iwafune then pulls out from the hug to cup Nagare's face between his hands, still in disbelief at this miracle. The boy smiles faintly at him, his face rosy with color, and his blue eyes now glint vitality compared to the sickly look before. There's a faint green glow in his left eye but Iwafune brushes it off as a small side effect.
