Nagare seems pretty healthy for someone who just recovered from a major surgery, the boy is beaming with energy, asking Iwafune if he could walk around. The older man frowns, saying that it is too risky at the moment, making the boy pout but he listens anyway. Iwafune carefully checks the boy's vitals, and all the numbers end up surprisingly well, too well to be natural, like the sharp gaze he can feel from Nagare, too sharp for his liking. 

“Nagare, you have to be honest with me, are you feeling ok right now, any pain, ache, or discomfort?” Iwafune puts away his stethoscope, his face a mixture of relief and worry.

Nagare shook his head, happy, and confidently said, “Nope, I feel great, Iwa-san, probably the greatest I have felt all my life.”

This time, it is Iwafune who feels an aching pain in his heart, it is just a simple statement from the boy, but this freedom was deprived of him due to the unfairness of fate. Maybe, the parasite was a gift from God after all, a chance for Nagare to have a normal life and a chance for Iwafune to redeem himself, to save at least someone in this decaying world. 

Nagare goes through a speedy recovery, and Iwafune makes sure to monitor him at all times, switching between the attentive doctor and doting father persona as he sees fit. For him, medical procedure isn't enough, Iwafune would lay down on the same bed as Nagare and listen to the boy's heartbeat as if to directly confirm that his precious son is still here with him. 

They form their sanctuary, blocking all that noise from the outside world, and Iwafune is contended with this life, but he knows that sooner or later Nagare will be curious and ask him about the outside world. 

“Iwa-san, I’m bored. Can I watch some cartoons on TV?” Nagare pleads with him with the big puppy eyes that he knows Iwafune can’t resist.

“Sure, but just a few episodes, ok, you are still recovering.” Iwafune smiles and turns back to the kitchen space to heat some canned food for them.

The muffled cartoon noises ringing in the background as Iwafune stares at the boiling soup on the stove, his mind seems to swirl together with the liquid in the soup. ‘What now?’ a voice whispered inside his head, ‘even when you can save him, you can't stay down here forever and the outside world is no longer a safe place either’

A loud beeping noise from the smoke detector snaps Iwafune out of his trance, he frantically turns off the stove and fans off the smoke. Then he quickly dumps the soup contents into separate bowls. 

“Sorry, Nagare, it takes too long but let's eat now,” he carries the slightly burned soups to the room. But instead of loud and cheerful cartoon noise from the TV, what he heard is news, about the inflected taking over the city. And as he glances over to the bed, Nagare is staring at the screen with intense focus. 

Iwafune quickly put the bowls down, grabbed the remote, and turned off the TV. An uncomfortable silence filled the room, seconds felt like an eternity, until Nagare's soft voice broke, “Am I one of them, Iwa-san?” The boy's voice was neutral like he was just stating a fact, not asking a question.

“No, what are you talking about, Nagare? You are normal, you are not like them, not at all,” Iwafune frantically grabs Nagare's shoulder, his first instinct is to lie despite feeling guilty over it. 

“Do you still love me even when I turn like them?” Nagare's voice is small, a crack of vulnerability showing, in contrast with earlier neutrality. Iwafune can see the flicker of green in the boy's left eye but the pleading look on his face tugs on the older man's heartstrings.

“Of course, I would still love you no matter what you become, Nagare. But I promise you, I will try my best to make sure you won't turn like that,” Iwafune pulls Nagare into a warm embrace, relishing in the boy's body heat and the steady beating of his heart.

As days pass, Iwafune can no longer tell Nagare to stay put, the boy is now a bundle of energy, clinging to his father in every move, curiously exploring every corner of the basement. Iwafune just knows how to sigh and smile as it is such a good leap from the sickly, bedridden kid he once knew. 

One time, Iwafune had his pen rolled underneath the cabinet, which made him struggle for a while to get it out. When Nagare sees that, he offers to help his father, "let me do it, Iwa-san," the boy says as he moves the entire cabinet away with his bare hand, which even a grown adult man like Iwafune can't.

Iwafune's mouth gapes in astonishment and fear, as it confirms the change in Nagare that Iwafune desperately ignored purposely. But how can he address it when Nagare looks back at him with a proud expression, like he managed to help his father in some way?

Iwafune forces an awkward smile and pats Nagare's head, “Thank you, Nagare,” but his demeanor does not get past Nagare's sharp look, the boy tilts his head, his habit when he is confused, “Did I do something wrong, Iwa-san?”

Iwafune immediately feels guilty and grabs Nagare's shoulder, trying to reassure the boy, “No, Nagare, you didn't do anything wrong.” He hesitates before continuing, “It is just… this amount of strength is not normal,” 

Nagare tilts his head again as if to digest Iwafune's statement, then he said, “But why does it matter, Iwa-san, if it makes life easier for us,” the boy answers in a matter-of-fact tone like such change to him is not such a big deal. 

The answer makes Iwafune heartache, torn between wanting to explain everything to Nagare but also not wanting to crush his childhood innocence, “It might not be a big deal now, but what if you are hurting, what if it will cause you pain in the future… I can't bear seeing you get hurt, Nagare,” he answers sincerely, his hand caressing the boy's cheek.

Nagare big blue eyes blink, seeing the love and concern in Iwafune's gesture, his small hand then placed on top of Iwafune hand, as if to reassure the older man, “I am fine, Iwa-san, I guarantee, I feel my best right now, and I want us to take advantage of this time together.” As Nagare lets go, he leans over and kisses Iwafune on the cheek, more affectionately than usual, “I love you, father,” he said with a small smile.
