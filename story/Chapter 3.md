Iwafune wakes up feeling renovated or lobotomized, or something in between. Instead of dreading the emptiness inside, he embraces it, whatever Nagare does to him does not get rid of his despair, just makes it more bearable. Speaking of the culprit, Nagare curls up peacefully beside him, cuddling around his arm like the events last night never happened. 

If Iwafune was attached to Nagare before, he is addicted to him now. Nagare is a better drug than alcohol and cigarettes, bringing him a soothing comfort while exposing him to the abyss of his heart. Gently shaking Nagare awake, he is both dreadful and excited about what his salvation might bring to the table today.

Iwafune should be ashamed of this role reversal, he is the father, and he should be the one taking care of his son. But now, he pathetically clings to Nagare for comfort, guidance, and reassurance, like what the boy promised him in that ‘dream verse’. Nagare stirs awake, his blue eyes blinking in the sunlight, the green glint has disappeared for now. Iwafune realized right away, that this is not ‘that’ Nagare, and felt a pang of disappointment in his chest. 

 But even this Nagare is sharp, as the kid clings to his sleeve and tugs, “Are you still mad at me, Iwa-san?” The blue eyes stare at him sincerely, he must be referring to the bite mark incident that left them strained last time, not knowing that they are already made up in the ‘dream world’.

Iwafune ruffles the boy's hair, but the action and the word that followed seem forced and hollowed, “No, I am not mad, Nagare, and I'm sorry too for acting out and hurting you,”
As he looks at Nagare's innocent face, he can't help but think back about the kiss and the blissful activity they did last night, guilt and shame resurface.

“I'm sorry too, Iwa-san,” Nagare looks up at Iwafune, his voice sincere and steady, “unknowingly or not, I think I hurt you more than I realized,” 

Iwafune's heart is pounding inside his chest, he half wants to ask Nagare to confirm but also wants to keep things the same way now. So he acts without thinking, as to him it is the only thing that can confirm his theory, Iwafune tilts Nagare's chin up and admires the deep blue ocean of his eyes before leaning in and kissing him. 

Unlike the ‘dream’, Iwafune is the one in control, while Nagare softly yelps in surprise but submits to it anyway. It is too late to turn back now as they both cross the boundaries, in both worlds. 

What does Iwafune expect out of this kiss, to ‘trigger’ the memory in the ‘dream’ world, to bring the ‘dark’ Nagare, but he does not expect the reaction in front of him? Nagare's eyes threaten to spill with tears, his lips are glossy from the kiss, his cheeks rosy, and the boy's small finger touches his lips as if to get to terms with the situation. 

Guilt pours down on Iwafune like a bucket of ice water, he feels like a real monster in this room, selfish and cowardly, and now he has hurt the most precious to him, the one he tried his best to save. 

Iwafune tries to reach out to comfort Nagare, but does he have the right to do that since he was the one who caused the pain in the first place? “I'm sorry, Nagare…” his voice is barely a whisper. But no matter how many empty words he spits out, the damage is already done, and their relationship will never be the same again.

“I don't hate it…” Nagare finally speaks after what feels like an eternity, his small hands fiddling awkwardly with the hem of his shirt, making it not clear if he is saying the truth or just saying it to please Iwafune. 

What Nagare just said opens a can of worms, complicating their already messy relationship, “what do you mean by that, Nagare?” There are a million questions Iwafune wants to ask, but he wants to gauge the situation first by letting Nagare have a first say.

“It means I don't mind doing it again with Iwa-san,” Iwafune never expected Nagare's straightforward nature would hit him right in the chest like a sledgehammer, breaking down any self-preservation he had left. 

“You don't know what you just said, Nagare,” Iwafune covers his face with his palm, then hits his forehead in confusion and frustration, mostly at himself. 

“Oh, Iwa-san, I know exactly what I want,” Nagare said, his voice absolutely unlike the fragile facade earlier, it made Iwafune wonder what is an act and what is real. He looks into the boy's eyes, there is no trace of green, not yet, which for some reason, scared him even more.

As if sensing Iwafune's discomfort, Nagare continues his monologue, “Unlike adults, kids like me are more open and honest to their feelings,” Nagare gets closer, his innocent face contrasting with his wisdom, “It's ok to let go, Iwa-san, it is not a shame to admit what you like,” 

“This is wrong, this is so wrong, Nagare,” Iwafune slowly paced away from the boy, until he reached the wall, trapped between it and Nagare. “It was a mistake, ok, and I would be a big fool if I dared to repeat it,” Iwafune clutches his head as if that could block out the intensity of Nagare's gaze.

“You could be a fool, but at least you can live true to yourself, Iwa-san,” Nagare words are still strangely mature but now carry a more sincere tone, “the sooner you let go, the easier you can truly live,” the boy reaches over, hugging Iwafune, his short frame can only reach up to his waist.

“Who are you, what are you doing to my son? bring him back, bring Nagare back…” Iwafune collapses, crouching down on the floor, clutching his head in frustration, this is too much, this whole thing was a mistake. He knew it, he should not defy nature in the first place.

“Iwa-san, calm down,” it is just a simple word but its commanding tone snaps Iwafune out of his trance, and looks up at Nagare, who looks down at him with a gaze mixed with pity, and sadness. The boy then cups Iwafune's cheeks between his hands, gently like a precious thing, “Please let me take care of you, you have done enough,” 

Nagare's thumbs gently wiped out the tears that threatened to spill on Iwafune's face, “I am always myself, Iwa-san, as I know myself better than anyone,” he rested his forehead against Iwafune, “was my old self an act? Not really, because I truly feel safe with you, so I can be a child around you. But this persona, it is also me, Iwa-san, messy and ugly, just like yours…” Nagare confesses, like a sinner to the priest. 

Iwafune is too numb to reply, he is now like a deer in the headlights, like a fawn trapped in the grip of a lion, instinct tells him that he should fight back, but the bleakness of reality tells him not to. Deep inside, he wants to believe Nagare, but if the boy already deceived him once, what to prove that this is not another act?
“Messy and ugly,” Nagare repeated, his voice soft but unyielding. “The part of me that wants too much, that takes and takes until there’s nothing left. That’s me too, Iwa-san.” Their face still pressed close to each other, Nagare's hands effectively trap Iwafune in place, “if you give me your everything, I will give my all to you as well,” he smiles as he leans in close, too close for Iwafune comfort, his blue eyes stare at Iwafune's brown ones as if to hypnotize them. Then, as a final act before the curtain call, is their third kiss. 
Iwafune is left paralyzed on the spot, not by any external force, but by his fear, a kiss is not simply a kiss, but a promise, a claim, and a curse that Nagare put on him. Seeing that Iwafune is stiff on the spot, Nagare plays with the older man's face, tilts his head innocently, and sing-song in his childish voice, “Come on, Iwa-san, don't be so down, we got lots of things to do,” the boy grabs Iwafune hand and pull him up.
