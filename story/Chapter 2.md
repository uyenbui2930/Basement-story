From that day on, it is as if there is a shift in their relationship, Nagare becomes even clingier and affectionate than usual. So Iwafune can only use his alone time at night, when Nagare is sleeping, to search through the news for the outside world situation. 

He sighs as he realizes their supplies in the basement are running low and sooner or later they have to go to the surface, either to gather supplies or to move to the new place. And in that dark of night, there are times Iwafune wonders if he is being watched, but as he turns around, there's nothing there except Nagare's peaceful sleeping form and the darkness of the room. He brushes it off as stress but the uneasy feeling keeps intensifying day by day. 

“Can I borrow your laptop, Iwa-san?” Nagare asks one day, after finishing his cartoon on the TV. 
“What are you gonna use that for?” Iwafune raised his eyebrows skeptically. 
“Just searching for more cartoons on the internet, Iwa-san, there's not a lot on TV,” Nagare explains, with a small smile and puppy eyes that are Iwafune's weak spot, but there's something sharper about them that Iwafune can't explain. 
“Fine, but not too long, I have to use that too,” Iwafune sighs as he closes his news tabs, and hands over the laptop to Nagare, who accepts it with a happy smile. 

Nagare lays down on the bed, the laptop rests on the pillows, and cheerful cartoon noise is in the background. Iwafune is watching him from the couch, sipping coffee, however, the uneasy feelings from the nights and earlier cannot be washed away.

Iwafune wakes up to Nagare nudging him in the stomach, for some reason, he has dozed off on the couch, which is unusual considering it is still morning. 
“Iwa-san, wake up,” Nagare then sits on his lap, his small hands wrapping around Iwafune's neck as if to stir the older man out of his sleepy state.

Iwafune's head is pounding, his mind groggy and his vision foggy, but even then, he can still see the flicker of green, now shining more prominently on Nagare's left eye. 
“Play with me, Iwa-san,” Nagare pouts, or attempts to pout, as he can still see the small glint of a smile in the corner of the kid's mouth. His small hands played with Iwafune's face, exploring his facial features both with childlike innocence and deliberate touch. “You get lots of stubble now, you need to shave soon, Iwa-san,” Nagare rubs both his hands against the stubble and for some reason, Iwafune feels small, like a prey being played with by the predator. 

Iwafune tries to speak, but his voice is stuck in his throat like there's sand trapping inside, paralyzing him like a prisoner of his own body. Nagare now rests his head on Iwafune's neck, his breath hot against it, sending a shiver down his spine, “Iwa-san is mine, so you have to take better care of yourself, so you can take care of me,” as Nagare finishes his sentence, he bites down on Iwafune neck, not too painful but enough force to leave a mark, and if Iwafune could speak right now, he would yelp, scream or scold Nagare, but none of it slip his mind at the moment. 

Iwafune jolts awake again, cold sweats running down his back and forehead, looking around, Nagare is not on top of him but sleeping soundly in the bed, the laptop still blasting cheerful cartoon noise in the background. Was it a nightmare? Iwafune checks the clock, it is only an hour since then. Was he really in such a deep sleep in the morning? Iwafune then unconsciously touches his neck, shiver runs down his spine as he finds a trace of a bitemark, faint but there.

Despite his panic and worries, Iwafune still gently wakes Nagare up, the boy blinks and rubs his eyes, looking so adorable and innocent compared to the twisted image in the dream, well, Iwafune will give Nagare the benefit of the doubt before confronting him.

“Nagare, please be honest with me, did you do this to me?” Iwafune goes straight to the point, tilting his neck to show Nagare the bite mark.

Nagare just blinked at the mark, then shook his head, “Nope, I didn't do it, I was sleeping the whole time,” then his small hand reached out to touch the mark, “Does it hurt, Iwa-san,” 

Iwafune swats Nagare's hands away, his tone harsher than expected, “I did not raise a liar, Nagare, if it's not you, then is someone in here? Just admit it for god sake,” he gritted his teeth, grabbing the boy's hand with force.

When Iwafune snapped out of his trance of anger, he was immediately filled with regret and shame as he saw Nagare's tear-stained face and his small frame whimpering in pain, “it hurt, Iwa-san,” Iwafune muttered apologizing as he released the hand. 

After that incident, their relationship felt strained, Nagare no longer happily clings to him, and Iwafune, due to guilt, avoids touching the boy. As they quietly eat the soups in their respective bowls, Iwafune wonders if he qualifies to be a father if this whole thing is a mistake. The soup suddenly felt hard to swallow, and he was ashamed of himself for that kind of thought. 

“Are you going to return me, Iwa-san?” Nagare stops eating, his voice quiet but the words ring loudly in Iwafune's ears.

“No, of course not, Nagare, I love you and you know that,” Iwafune corrects him, the pause in between is longer than he would like, “I'm just tired…and I was not myself…at that time…” 

Sometimes, Iwafune looks at himself in the mirror and thinks, did he bite more than he can chew? Like making an impulsive decision to adopt a kid when he can barely take care of himself? Those thoughts make him ashamed of himself but they keep coming back, like water flowing through an open dam. 

Nagare was a difficult kid, and it is not just because of his heart condition, he had been returning to the orphanage several times, due to unknown reasons. But it all made sense, it was said that the boy was a sole survivor of a catastrophic event that wiped out the whole city, it is normal to have some screw loose in the head. And Iwafune, being the bleeding heart he is, brings the kid home without a second thought. 

Maybe they see the loneliness in each other, and by clinging to the other, they think they will fill the void within. Iwafune thinks to himself as the ‘paralysis session’ returns, blurring between dream and reality, but this time, he can talk freely.

“What do you want to do with me, Nagare, or whatever that is taking over his body?” Iwafune asks, his tone calmer and more casual than he would like to. 

“Negative, I am Nagare, Iwa-san, always has been, and for your information, I just want to spend time with you. Isn't it normal for a son to want to bond with his father?” Nagare climbs on top of Iwafune's body, now lying helplessly on the bed. The boy's smile is innocent but the glint in his green left eye said otherwise. 

Iwafune can't respond, his mouth opens and closes but nothing comes out, Nagare words make sense, during the time they lived together before the outbreak, did Iwafune know Nagare? If so, whether the boy is under the parasite's influence or not makes no difference to him.

“You want to save someone, to find a purpose in your meaningless life, Iwa-san,” Nagare hand gently caressed his cheek, “and I happen to be there, a helpless child that needs to be saved, so in a way, it works out for both of us,” 

"But don't worry Iwa-san, I will make sure you never feel meaningless again," Nagare leans down and kisses him, unexpected but not unwelcoming. The warmth of the kiss is in contrast to the coldness of something that enters Iwafune's body, into his nerves, right to his brain, taking control of his life like Nagare is right now. Is he getting infected, controlled into Nagare's, or the parasite pawn, why does he feel relieved right now, like all the tension and despair has been sucked out of his body.
