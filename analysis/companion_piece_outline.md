## ACT 1: THE FACILITY (~1,200 words)

### Purpose
- Establish Iwafune's pre-catastrophe character
- Show his relationship with the facility
- Introduce the outbreak threat
- Set up his moral framework (follows orders, trusts authority)

### Setting
- Research facility (underground? remote?)
- Clinical, sterile, institutional
- Iwafune in field operative role

### Scenes

#### Scene 1.1: Morning Briefing (300 words)
**Location**: Facility briefing room
**Characters**: Iwafune, Commander/Superior, other operatives

**Key moments**:
- Iwafune receives assignment: outbreak in [City Name]
- Details: Parasite infection, spreading rapidly
- Orders: Contain, quarantine, assess survivors
- Iwafune's mindset: This is what I signed up for

**Dialogue**:
> "Containment protocol is absolute. No unauthorized exits from the quarantine zone."
>
> Iwafune nodded. He'd followed orders for six years. This would be no different.

**Establish**:
- Iwafune as "good soldier"
- Facility as morally grey (clinical about human cost)
- His belief in the mission (naive idealism)

---

#### Scene 1.2: Preparation (200 words)
**Location**: Iwafune's quarters / Equipment room

**Key moments**:
- Packing gear (hazmat, weapons, samples kits)
- Brief character reflection
- Last normal moment before everything changes

**Internal thought**:
> Six years he'd worked for them. Six years of believing they were protecting humanity from the parasites. He'd seen the infected—the ones who'd lost themselves to the organisms. He'd never questioned the necessity of containment.
>
> Not yet.

**Foreshadowing**: "Not yet"

---

#### Scene 1.3: The Mission Begins (700 words)
**Location**: En route to city / Arrival at perimeter

**Key moments**:
- Travel to outbreak site
- First signs of catastrophe (smoke on horizon)
- Arrival at quarantine perimeter
- Reality worse than briefing suggested

**Sensory details**:
- Smoke visible miles away
- Radio chatter (panicked, fragmented)
- Checkpoint chaos (soldiers, refugees trying to escape)
- The smell (burning, death)

**Iwafune's realization**:
> The briefing had called it "an outbreak."
>
> This was annihilation.

**Tension building**:
- City already lost
- Infection spread faster than anticipated
- Survivors trapped inside
- Orders unchanged: Contain. Document. No rescues.

**End of Act 1**: Iwafune enters the dead city.

---

## ACT 2: THE CATASTROPHE (~2,000 words)

### Purpose
- Show the horror of the outbreak (visceral, intense)
- Iwafune encounters survivors (including young Nagare)

- Iwafune walks away (inciting wound)

### Setting
- Ruined city (burning, bodies, monsters)
- Nightmare landscape
- Isolated pockets of survivors

### Scenes

**Action**:
- Team ambushed by infected
- Iwafune forced to kill former humans
- Equipment damaged, communication lost
- Separated from team (now alone)

**Emotional beat**:

>
> He pulled the trigger. Again. Again.
>
> The screaming never stopped.

---

#### Scene 2.2: The Survivor Pocket (600 words)
**Location**: Makeshift shelter (school? community center?)

**Key moments**:
- Iwafune finds group of survivors (20-30 people)
- Desperate, traumatized, begging for help
- He calls for evacuation (orders: DENIED)
- "Containment protocol absolute. No rescues."

**Characters**:
- Survivors: Families, children, elderly
- All doomed

**Radio exchange** (crucial):
> "Command, I have survivors. Thirty civilians, including children. Requesting immediate evacuation."
>
> Static. Then: "Negative. Containment protocol is absolute. Document and withdraw."
>
> "They're not infected—"
>
> "You have your orders, Operative."

**Iwafune's choice**:
- Obey orders = leave them to die
- Disobey = abandon facility, become fugitive
- He hesitates
- Survivors watch him
- He makes the choice: Obey

**Why he obeys**:
- Years of conditioning
- Belief in authority
- Fear of consequences
- Tells himself: "They know better than I do"

**Guilt seed planted**:
> He turned away from their pleas.
>
> Told himself it was the right thing.
>
> Knew it was a lie.

---

#### Scene 2.3: The Boy in the Wreckage (900 words)
**Location**: Ruined residential area

**Key moments**:
- Iwafune extracting from city
- Finds child (Nagare, age 6-8) in wreckage
- Boy is alive, alone, silent
- The moment that will haunt him

**Nagare's appearance**:
- Small, frail, covered in ash
- Blue eyes watching (unnervingly calm)
- Not crying, not screaming
- Just... observing

**The encounter**:
- Iwafune approaches
- Checks boy for infection (negative)
- Boy doesn't speak
- Watches Iwafune with those eyes

**Critical moment**:
> The boy tilted his head, studying Iwafune's face through the gas mask's visor. Brown eyes met blue.
>
> Iwafune crouched beside him. "What's your name?"
>
> No answer. Just that steady, unsettling gaze.
>
> "I—" Iwafune's radio crackled. "Operative, report status. Withdraw immediately. Quarantine perimeter closing in ten minutes."
>
> Ten minutes. He could carry the boy out. Could save one life from this hell.
>
> "Operative, confirm."
>
> Iwafune's hand hovered over the boy's shoulder.

**The choice** (parallel to survivor pocket):
- Save the boy = disobey, risk infection spread, become fugitive
- Leave the boy = follow orders, survive, go home
- He's already left the others
- What's one more?

**The moment**:
> "I'm sorry," Iwafune whispered.
>
> The boy didn't react. Didn't beg. Didn't cry.
>
> Just watched as Iwafune stood. Turned. Walked away.
>
> Behind him, a small voice, barely audible: "Okay."
>
> Iwafune didn't look back.

**Iwafune's rationalization**:
- Boy might be infected (incubating)
- Orders are orders
- He's not a monster (is he?)
- Someone else will help
- It's not his responsibility

**Truth**: He's afraid. Afraid of consequences. Afraid of choosing.

**Last image**:
> Iwafune reached the perimeter as the explosions began. Containment protocol. They were burning the city. Burning the infected. Burning the survivors.
>
> Burning a small boy with blue eyes who'd said "Okay" when abandoned.
>
> Iwafune vomited inside his mask.

**End of Act 2**: Iwafune escapes. The city burns. Nagare presumably dies.

- Disbelief
- Heart racing
- Tells himself it's coincidence
- Blue eyes are common
- It can't be him

**But**:
> It had to be him.
>
> Fate was giving him a second chance.
>
> Or condemning him to face what he'd done.

**Decision**:
> Iwafune made the call the next morning.
>
> "I'm interested in adopting."

**End of Act 3**: Iwafune drives to the orphanage.

---

## ACT 4: THE ORPHANAGE (~2,000 words)

### Purpose
- The recognition moment (ambiguous)
- Show Nagare's orphanage pattern (testing adoptive parents)
- Iwafune's motivations (atonement + genuine care)
- Early relationship building
- Establish their dynamic

### Setting
- Municipal orphanage (cold, institutional)
- Iwafune's apartment (during early adoption)

### Scenes

#### Scene 4.1: First Meeting (700 words)
**Location**: Orphanage director's office / meeting room

**Key moments**:
- Iwafune meets with director
- Director warns about Nagare (difficult, multiple returns)
- "But he needs someone patient. Are you patient, Mr. Iwafune?"
- Iwafune: "I can try."

**Nagare is brought in**:

**The moment**:
> The door opened.
>
> A small boy entered, blue eyes sweeping the room with clinical precision before landing on Iwafune.
>
> Time stopped.
>
> It was him. The boy from the burning city. Older now—ten, maybe eleven—but the same unsettling calm. The same watchful gaze.
>
> Iwafune's breath caught.

**Does Nagare recognize him?**

**Ambiguous description**:
> The boy tilted his head, studying Iwafune's face.
>
> Something flickered in those blue eyes. Recognition? Curiosity? Or just the habitual assessment of another potential disappointment?
>
> "Hello," Nagare said softly. "Are you here for me?"
>
> The words were simple. Innocent. But something in the tone—
>
> Iwafune pushed the thought away. The boy had been six, maybe seven, when they'd met. In a burning city. Wearing a gas mask. It was impossible.
>
> "Yes," Iwafune managed. "I'd like to get to know you, Nagare."
>
> Nagare's expression didn't change. "Okay."
>
> The same word. The same tone.
>
> Iwafune's hands were shaking.

**Key technique**: NEVER confirm if Nagare remembers. Every detail is ambiguous.

**Possibilities**:
- Nagare recognizes voice?
- Nagare recognizes eyes (same brown eyes, no mask now)?
- Nagare just being polite?
- Nagare testing already?

**Leave it uncertain.**

---

#### Scene 4.2: The Director's Warning (400 words)
**Location**: Director's office (private conversation)

**Key moments**:
- Director explains Nagare's history
- Sole survivor of [City] catastrophe
- Found in wreckage weeks after quarantine lifted
- Severe trauma, selective mutism (for first year)
- Five adoptions, five returns

**Pattern**:
- Honeymoon period (2-3 weeks, perfect child)
- Testing phase (small incidents, pushing boundaries)
- Escalation (bigger issues, manipulation emerging)
- Return (adoptive parents give up)

**Director's theory**:
> "He's testing them. Seeing if they'll leave like everyone else did. It's trauma response—push people away before they can abandon you."

**Iwafune's response**:
- Guilt intensifies (I DID abandon him)
- Determination hardens (I won't fail again)
- Accepts the challenge

**Director's final warning**:
> "He needs someone who won't give up on him. Can you be that person?"
>
> Iwafune looked through the window at Nagare, sitting alone in the play area, watching them with those knowing eyes.
>
> "I have to be."

---

#### Scene 4.3: Adoption Day (500 words)
**Location**: Orphanage / Car / Iwafune's apartment

**Key moments**:
- Paperwork finalized
- Nagare says goodbye to no one (has no friends)
- Car ride home (awkward silence)
- Showing Nagare his new room

**Nagare's behavior**:
- Polite but distant
- Watching Iwafune constantly
- Already assessing

**First night**:
> "Iwa-san," Nagare said from the doorway of his new room. The nickname had appeared naturally, unasked for.
>
> "Yes, Nagare?"
>
> "You won't return me, will you?"
>
> The question—so direct, so vulnerable—hit like a bullet.
>
> "Never," Iwafune said. Meant it. "I promise."
>
> Nagare studied his face for a long moment. Then nodded, satisfied.
>
> "Good. Because I don't want to go back."
>
> He said it simply. Matter-of-factly. But something in his eyes—
>
> Iwafune couldn't shake the feeling that Nagare knew. Knew everything. And had chosen to stay anyway.
>
> Or was choosing to test if Iwafune meant his promise.

**End scene**: Iwafune alone, watching Nagare sleep, feeling the weight of redemption and fear.

---

#### Scene 4.4: The Testing Period (400 words)
**Location**: Iwafune's apartment, over first 3 months

**Montage of incidents**:

1. **Week 3**: Small test
   - Nagare "accidentally" breaks expensive item
   - Watches Iwafune's reaction
   - Iwafune: "It's okay. We'll clean it up together."
   - Nagare: Slight surprise

2. **Month 2**: Bigger test
   - School calls: Nagare in fight
   - Other parents demand consequences
   - Iwafune: "Let's talk about what happened."
   - Nagare: Opening up slightly

3. **Month 3**: Major test
   - Nagare throws massive tantrum
   - Breaking things, screaming
   - Waiting for Iwafune to snap
   - Iwafune: Stays calm, holds him until he cries

**The breakthrough**:
> After the tantrum, Nagare collapsed in Iwafune's arms, small body shaking with sobs.
>
> "You're not leaving?" Small voice, broken.
>
> "I'm not leaving."
>
> "Promise?"
>
> "I promise. No matter what you do, Nagare. I'm staying."
>
> Something shifted. The testing didn't stop completely—Nagare was too damaged for that—but it softened. Trust, fragile and new, began to form.

**Iwafune's realization**:
> He'd saved the boy. Finally. Years too late, in the wrong way, but—
>
> He'd saved him.
>
> And himself, maybe.

- Will do ANYTHING

**Nagare's reaction**:
- Calm acceptance
- "It's okay, Iwa-san. You tried."
- That same "okay" from the burning city
- Iwafune: NOPE. Not accepting it.

**Decision forming**:
> The facility had parasites. Specimens. He'd seen the reports—organisms that could repair host tissue.
>
> Side effects were catastrophic. But Nagare was dying anyway.
>
> Iwafune began planning.

>
> For one child. His child.

---

#### Scene 5.3: The Infiltration (1,000 words)
**Location**: The Facility (night)

**Genre shift**: ACTION/THRILLER

**Key moments**:

**Entry**:
- Iwafune arrives late night
- Old badge still works (security oversight)
- Enters as "equipment inspection"
- Heart pounding

**Descent**:
- Navigating familiar corridors
- Avoiding cameras (knows blind spots)
- Sublevel access (locked)
- Bypass with stolen code

**Specimen Storage**:
- Cold, clinical, horror
- Rows of containers
- Infected tissue samples
- Live parasite specimens

**The choice**:
- Multiple specimens
- Iwafune studies labels
- Finds one: "Specimen 47: Regenerative strain, cardiac integration successful (animal trials)"
- This one. Has to be this one.

**Complication**:
- Alarm triggered (motion sensor he missed)
- Guards responding
- 5 minutes before lockdown

**Escape**:
- Grabs specimen
- Runs
- Guards shouting
- Gunfire? (Warning shots)
- Iwafune evades (knows facility layout)
- Emergency exit (roof access)
- Barely escapes

**Chase**:
- Facility alerts
- Iwafune running through parking lot
- Into car
- Speeds away
- No pursuit (they don't know who it was?)
- Or don't care enough? (just a specimen)

**Safe**:
> Iwafune drove for an hour before pulling over.
>
> Hands shaking, he examined the container. The parasite inside pulsed with sickly bioluminescence.
>
> Grotesque. Alien. Horrifying.
>
> Hope.

**Location**: Iwafune's apartment (late night)

**Key moments**:
- Iwafune returns home
- Nagare sleeping (deteriorating)
- Hides specimen in refrigerator
- Sits beside Nagare's bed
- Wrestling with decision

**The dilemma**:
- Use parasite = save Nagare, but transform him
- Don't use = Nagare dies
- No good choice
- Only terrible ones

**Foreshadowing main story**:
> Iwafune touched the boy's hand. So small. So fragile.
>
> "I don't know if this is the right choice," he whispered. "I don't know if there is a right choice. But I can't lose you. Not again."
>
> Nagare stirred in his sleep, murmuring something inaudible.
>
> Iwafune made his decision.
>
> He'd carry this weight. Whatever came after. Whatever Nagare became.
>
> They'd face it together.

**End of Act 5**: Iwafune resolved. Specimen acquired. Choice made (but not yet enacted).

## EPILOGUE (~300 words)

### Purpose
- Bridge to main story Prologue
- Show time passage
- Outbreak begins (current/global)
- Iwafune forced to use specimen NOW
- Leads directly into "Use the parasite" branch

### Setting
- Apartment
- News broadcasts (new outbreak spreading)
- Nagare's condition critical
- Hospital chaos

### Key moments

**The new outbreak**:
> Three months later, the world ended.
>
> Not the city. The world.
>
> The parasite strain had mutated. Spread globally. The infection that had destroyed Nagare's city now consumed nations.

**Forced hand**:
> Hospitals overrun. Transplants impossible. Nagare's heart failing.
>
> Iwafune stared at the specimen container, pulsing with that sickly glow.
>
> He'd stolen it months ago. Kept it hidden. Hoped he'd never need it.
>
> But Nagare was dying. And the world outside was screaming.

**The decision (leads to Prologue)**:
> Iwafune carried Nagare to the basement.
>
> Prepared the makeshift operating table.
>
> Held the parasite vial up to the light.
>
> "Forgive me," he whispered.
>
> Nagare's eyes opened slightly, blue and trusting.
>
> "It's okay, Iwa-san."
>
> The same words. Always the same words.
>
> This time, Iwafune wouldn't walk away.

**Final line**:
> He began the operation.

**[TRANSITION TO MAIN STORY PROLOGUE: "Use the parasite" branch]**

---

## Ambiguity Maintenance Checklist

**Does Nagare recognize Iwafune at orphanage?**

✅ Description allows both interpretations:
- Could be recognition
- Could be standard assessment
- Iwafune uncertain
- Readers uncertain
- NEVER CONFIRMED

**Nagare POV NEVER shown:**
- Everything filtered through Iwafune
- Nagare's thoughts remain mystery
- His awareness ambiguous
- Even in testing phase (strategy or trauma response?)

**Works if:**
- ✅ Nagare remembered him from catastrophe
- ✅ Nagare didn't remember (too young, traumatized)
- ✅ Nagare suspects but can't confirm
- ✅ Nagare knows and is playing long game

**All interpretations valid** = successful ambiguity

## Writing Guidelines

### Tone Differences from Main Story:

**Main Story**:
- Intimate, contained
- Psychological horror
- Internal focus
- Slow, oppressive
- Two people, one room

**Companion Piece**:
- External events matter
- Action/thriller elements
- World-building allowed
- Faster pace (covers years)
- Multiple locations

**BUT maintain**:
- Iwafune's internal guilt
- Intimate emotional moments
- Nagare's mystery
- Psychological depth
- Same prose style

### Prose Style:
- Match main story's voice
- Shorter paragraphs for action
- Longer paragraphs for guilt/reflection
- Sensory details (especially catastrophe)
- Iwafune's internal narration

### What to SHOW:
- The catastrophe (visceral, horrifying)
- Iwafune's choice to obey
- Years of guilt
- Orphanage dynamic
- Infiltration (tense, exciting)

### What to HINT:
- Nagare's awareness
- Facility's true nature
- Why outbreak happened
- Iwafune's exact role

### What to NEVER REVEAL:
- Nagare's thoughts
- Whether he remembers
- His manipulation strategy (if any)
- Full facility conspiracy

## Companion Piece Purpose

### For readers who ONLY read main story:
- Main story is complete
- Works standalone
- Crumbs create intrigue

### For readers who read BOTH:
- Main story gains massive depth
- Every line Nagare says recontextualized
- Iwafune's guilt fully understood
- Relationship complexity revealed
- **Still ambiguous** (Nagare's knowledge)

### Reading order flexibility:
- Main first: Mystery, then revelation
- Companion first: Dramatic irony throughout main
- Both work
