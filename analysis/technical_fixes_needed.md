## Grammar, Typos, and Consistency Errors

These are technical errors identified during chapter analysis that should be fixed before final publication.

---

## CHAPTER 1 FIXES

### Fix 1: POV Slip (Line 33) - CRITICAL

**Location**: Chapter 1, paragraph about Nagare's behavior

**Current (INCORRECT):**
```
He acts just like a normal kid without a single care in the world and it made me struggle to see the difference between him now and before, it is as if I operated on a completely different kid, but the faint glow in his left eye said otherwise.
```

**Fix To:**
```
He acts just like a normal kid without a single care in the world and it made him struggle to see the difference between him now and before, it is as if he operated on a completely different kid, but the faint glow in his left eye said otherwise.
```

**Error Type**: POV slip from third person to first person
**Severity**: HIGH - breaks narrative consistency
**Impact**: Reader pulled out of story, confusing

---

### Fix 2: Lie vs. Lay (Line 9)

**Current:**
```
Iwafune would lay down on the bed next to the operation table
```

**Fix To:**
```
Iwafune would lie down on the bed next to the operation table
```

**Error Type**: Incorrect verb form (lay/lie confusion)
**Severity**: MEDIUM - common grammar error
**Rule**:
- "Lie" = recline (lie, lay, lain)
- "Lay" = place something (lay, laid, laid)
- Here: Iwafune is reclining himself, so "lie"

### Fix 3: Contended vs. Contented (Line 11)

**Current:**
```
a small but contended smile on his face
```

**Fix To:**
```
a small but contented smile on his face
```

**Error Type**: Wrong word
**Severity**: LOW - still comprehensible
**Explanation**:
- "Contended" = competed, argued
- "Contented" = satisfied, peaceful
- Context requires "contented"

## CHAPTER 2 FIXES

### Fix 4: Phrasing Issue (Line 52)

**Current:**
```
like all the tension and despair has been sucking off his body
```

**Fix To:**
```
like all the tension and despair has been sucked out of his body
```

**Error Type**: Awkward/inappropriate phrasing
**Severity**: MEDIUM - current phrasing has unintended connotation
**Impact**: "sucking off" is slang with sexual meaning; should be "sucked out of"

## CHAPTER 4 FIXES

### Fix 5: Missing Possessive (Line 1-2)

**Current:**
```
but all Iwafune can do now is stare blankly at the boy back.
```

**Fix To:**
```
but all Iwafune can do now is stare blankly at the boy's back.
```

**Error Type**: Missing possessive apostrophe
**Severity**: LOW - typo
**Impact**: Minor grammatical error

## CHAPTER 5 FIXES

### Fix 6: Tempered vs. Tampered (Line 19) - CRITICAL

**Current:**
```
"I tempered a bit with your brain, to make you less sad…"
```

**Fix To:**
```
"I tampered a bit with your brain, to make you less sad…"
```

**Error Type**: Wrong word (changes meaning significantly)
**Severity**: HIGH - completely different meaning
**Explanation**:
- "Tempered" = moderated, strengthened (like tempering steel)
- "Tampered" = interfered with, altered illicitly
- Context requires "tampered" (Nagare altered Iwafune's brain)

## PROLOGUE FIXES

### Fix 7: Defections vs. Defects (Line 7)

**Current:**
```
the parasite can repair the injuries or defections in the host body.
```

**Fix To:**
```
the parasite can repair the injuries or defects in the host body.
```

**Error Type**: Wrong word
**Severity**: MEDIUM - changes meaning
**Explanation**:
- "Defections" = abandoning allegiance (political term)
- "Defects" = flaws, abnormalities (medical term)
- Context requires "defects"

## Notes

- These are separate from the backstory crumb additions
- Should be fixed even if you don't add crumbs
- All fixes are non-controversial (objective errors)
- None change story meaning or intent (except fixing errors)
- Can be done with simple Edit tool find/replace

*Once these technical fixes are complete, the prose will be cleaner and more professional.*
