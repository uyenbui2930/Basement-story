## What's Been Created

### 1. Crumb Additions (Ready to Apply)

**Five subtle moments** that hint at Iwafune's deeper past:

1. **Prologue** - Reference to first time failing Nagare (~80 words)
   - "walked away from a burning city and a small figure"
   - Establishes past guilt

2. **Chapter 2** - Reveals Iwafune was at the catastrophe (~90 words)
   - "Iwafune had been there that day"
   - Major reveal but still vague about his role

3. **Chapter 4** - Iwafune's guilt about giving up before (~120 words)
   - "Once, in a city consumed by fire and screaming"
   - Nagare's ambiguous response: "You did what you could"
   - Key line: "Unless he did. Iwafune didn't ask."

4. **Chapter 5** - Nagare's knowing words (~80 words)
   - "Even if it took you a while"
   - Could reference years between catastrophe and adoption
   - Ambiguity maintained: "Could he?"

5. **Optional Chapter 5** - Almost-confession moment (~60 words)
   - Iwafune almost tells everything but doesn't
   - Lists specific guilt: burning city, leaving child

**Total addition: 370-430 words** (depending on which Ch 5 version used)

**Key feature**: Ambiguity preserved - readers sense Nagare knows, but never confirmed

### 2. Technical Fixes (Ready to Apply)

**High Priority (Fix First):**
- Chapter 1, Line 33: POV slip - "made me struggle" → "made him struggle"
- Chapter 5, Line 19: "tempered" → "tampered" (wrong meaning)

**Medium Priority:**
- Prologue, Line 7: "defections" → "defects"
- Chapter 1, Line 9: "would lay down" → "would lie down"
- Chapter 2, Line 52: "sucking off" → "sucked out of"

**Low Priority:**
- Chapter 1, Line 11: "contended" → "contented"
- Chapter 4, Line 1-2: "boy back" → "boy's back"

**Total fixes: 7** (all objective corrections, no creative changes)

## Next Steps - Choose Your Path

### Option A: Apply Edits to Main Story

**What this involves:**
1. Apply 7 technical fixes (objective corrections)
2. Apply 5 crumb additions (backstory hints)
3. Review final flow
4. Main story ready for publication

**Time estimate**: ~1-2 hours of editing work
**Result**: Main story polished and deepened

---

### Option B: Outline Companion Piece "Before the Basement"

**What this involves:**
1. Use character bible as foundation
2. Create detailed scene-by-scene outline
3. Structure: ~8,000 words, 5-6 acts
4. Timeline: Catastrophe → Adoption → Illness → Infiltration → (leads to Prologue)

**Time estimate**: ~2-3 hours for detailed outline
**Result**: Blueprint ready for writing companion piece

---

### Option C: Both (Recommended Workflow)

**Sequential approach:**
1. **First**: Apply technical fixes to main story (clean up errors)
2. **Second**: Apply crumb additions to main story (add depth)
3. **Third**: Outline companion piece using character bible
4. **Fourth**: Write companion piece (separate session)

**Rationale**:
- Main story improvements are concrete and ready
- Companion piece requires more creative energy
- Having polished main story helps ensure consistency

## Key Decisions Already Made (Confirmed)

✅ Title: "What We Bury"
✅ Format: Traditional prose only (no VN, no IF, no branching)
✅ Nagare knows Iwafune's past (but readers never get confirmation)
✅ One parasite implant only (in Prologue)
✅ Two outbreaks: past (Nagare's city) + present (main story)
✅ Love nature: Complex (atonement + genuine + transactional + insurance)
✅ Structure: Main story + optional companion piece

## Character Bible Highlights (Completed)

### Iwafune's Core Journey:
- Pre-catastrophe: Idealistic field operative
- Catastrophe: Sees young Nagare, ordered to leave, obeys
- Post-catastrophe: "Meaningless life" guilt state
- Orphanage: Recognizes Nagare (uncertain), adopts (atonement + care)
- Pre-surgery: Infiltrates facility, steals parasite specimen

### Nagare's Core Journey:
- Pre-catastrophe: Already unusual (observant, intense)
- Catastrophe: Survives alone, man in gas mask walks away
- Orphanage: Testing pattern, multiple returns, strategic attachment developing
- Meeting Iwafune: Ambiguous recognition (déjà vu?), senses his need
- Early adoption: Observation → testing → attachment (strategic + genuine)

### The Psychology:
**Nagare's philosophy**: "I know what you did. I forgive you. But I'll keep this in my pocket in case you try to leave."

- NOT revenge
- Insurance (pragmatic survival)
- Forgiveness + self-protection
- Love + manipulation (not opposites for them)

## What's NOT Done Yet

**Main Story:**
- ⏳ Technical fixes not applied (drafted only)
- ⏳ Crumb additions not applied (drafted only)
- ⏳ Final flow review after edits

**Companion Piece:**
- ⏳ Detailed scene outline not created
- ⏳ Actual writing not started

**Other AUs** (mentioned but unexplored):
- Dollhouse (Coraline parody)
- Puppeteer (folk horror)
- Siren of the Deep
- Reflection Child (noir detective)
- Imposter (cyberspace)

---

## Recommended Immediate Next Action

**Apply the high-priority technical fixes first** (objective corrections):

1. Fix Chapter 1 POV slip (breaks immersion)
2. Fix Chapter 5 "tempered" → "tampered" (wrong meaning)

These are non-controversial fixes that improve the story without changing creative intent.

**Then decide:**
- Continue with remaining fixes + crumb additions?
- Move to companion piece outlining?
- Review what's been done so far?
